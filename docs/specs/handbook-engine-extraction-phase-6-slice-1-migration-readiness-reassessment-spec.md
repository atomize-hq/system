# Spec: Handbook Engine Extraction Phase 6 Slice 1 (Slice 6.1) - Migration Readiness Reassessment

## Status

- Planned validation/planning slice.
- Phase 6 is the next authoritative step after the landed Phase 1 through Phase 5 extraction work.
- This slice is a reassessment boundary only. It must not be treated as permission to start ownership/import implementation.
- Packet 6.1.2 ownership reassessment is now recorded in `docs/specs/handbook-engine-extraction-phase-6-slice-1-packet-6-1-2-ownership-matrix.md`.
- Packet 6.1.3 now resolves the readiness verdict and explicit deferrals below.
- Packet 6.1.4 now names the next boundary explicitly: because Packet 6.1.3 is **NOT READY**, the blocker routes back to the earlier Phase 1 Slice 1.5 layout-parameterization closeout seam rather than starting any ownership/integration planning family.

## Assumptions

1. The live repo currently satisfies the Phase 1 through Phase 5 migration gate in `HANDBOOK_ENGINE_EXTRACTION_PLAN.md`, and any follow-up to this slice should start from that live truth rather than from stale pre-closeout docs.
2. The current extracted workspace shape is real: `crates/engine`, `crates/pipeline`, `crates/flow`, and `crates/cli` are the primary owner layers, while `crates/compiler` remains a reviewed narrow compatibility/support seam.
3. The bounded current runtime wedge is intentionally retained. Phase 6 must not reinterpret that bounded posture as a hidden regression unless live code or tests prove a real migration-gate failure.
4. The main unresolved problem is no longer extraction mechanics; it is ownership/readiness reassessment: which crates remain handbook-owned and imported by Substrate versus which, if any, should move into Substrate ownership later.
5. This slice should stay narrow and produce a final readiness call plus the next planning boundary. If it uncovers a genuine Phase 1 through Phase 5 regression, that regression should be named explicitly and routed back to a narrow repair seam rather than widened into Phase 6.
6. Success is not “Substrate move planned.” Success is “the repo can now truthfully say whether it is ready for a separate ownership/integration planning family.”

## Objective

Reassess the post-extraction workspace against the root migration rule and decide whether the repo is ready for a separate ownership/integration plan.

The maintainer needs this slice because the extraction work is now landed through the closeout seams, but the root plan intentionally deferred the final ownership call. Success means:

- the Phase 1 through Phase 5 migration gate is revalidated against live repo truth
- each extracted crate is reassessed against the handbook-domain versus substrate-domain ownership rule
- the bounded current wedge is evaluated honestly without confusing intentional deferral with regression
- the repo ends with an explicit READY / NOT READY style migration-readiness reassessment
- the next planning artifact boundary is named, but ownership/import planning itself has not started yet

## Code Style

Prefer explicit evidence-backed ownership decisions over optimistic prose or premature import plans.

```rust
match ownership_decision {
    OwnershipDecision::HandbookOwnedImported => "clean adapter boundary; keep handbook as owner",
    OwnershipDecision::MoveIntoSubstrate => "center of gravity is substrate-specific",
    OwnershipDecision::Deferred => "not ready to move; keep ownership question open explicitly",
}
```

Conventions:

- name the live evidence behind each ownership call
- distinguish handbook-domain logic from substrate-domain pressure
- distinguish intentional boundedness from real regression
- prefer explicit deferral over wishful certainty
- if a real blocker exists, route it back to the narrow earlier seam that owns it

## Testing Strategy

- Framework: existing Rust integration/unit tests plus live authority/doc consistency checks
- Primary test levels:
  - root-authority sweep for Phase 6 wording and migration-gate truth
  - crate-surface inspection for owner-layer boundaries
  - targeted regression tests that anchor the most important completed seams
  - full workspace verification wall
- Coverage focus:
  - Phases 1 through 5 remain green against the migration gate
  - extracted crates are the real owner layers rather than `handbook-compiler`
  - the supported target wedge remains intentionally bounded and validated
  - CLI remains a thin shell rather than the future ownership target
  - Phase 6 conclusions stay grounded in live code/tests/docs, not only in earlier planning claims
- Coverage expectation:
  - if targeted rails or the full wall fail, the slice cannot call migration readiness complete
  - if the wall is green but ownership questions remain open, the slice must report that as a Phase 6 planning/output issue rather than overclaiming readiness

## Slice Scope

In scope:

- revalidate the Phase 1 through Phase 5 migration gate against current repo truth
- reassess `handbook-engine`, `handbook-pipeline`, `handbook-flow`, `handbook-cli`, and retained `handbook-compiler` posture against the root ownership rule
- identify whether any residual handbook-product assumptions still prevent a clean later import boundary
- decide whether the repo is ready for a separate ownership/integration planning family
- name the exact next planning artifact boundary after the reassessment

Out of scope:

- moving crates into Substrate
- writing the ownership/import plan itself
- adding new supported pipelines, stages, or consumers
- reopening a closed Phase 1 through Phase 5 seam without concrete live regression evidence
- broad CLI redesign, runtime widening, or new product behavior

## Current Repo-Truth Questions This Reassessment Must Resolve

| Surface | Current live posture | Phase 6 reassessment question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `handbook-engine` | typed canonical truth and layout contract surface is exported from the engine crate | is this crate handbook-domain reusable core that Substrate should import rather than own? |
| `handbook-pipeline` | target/runtime posture is catalog-backed and intentionally bounded | is this crate reusable enough to import as-is, or does its center of gravity still remain handbook-owned for longer? |
| `handbook-flow` | middle-layer composition remains the least clearly settled domain seam | is this genuinely reusable workflow composition, or still handbook-specific enough to defer any ownership move? |
| `handbook-cli` | CLI is now the thin product shell | should this remain purely handbook-owned and explicitly excluded from any ownership/import target? |
| retained `handbook-compiler` seam | compiler remains narrowed compatibility/support glue rather than the implementation center | can later planning treat this as temporary retained glue to retire, and not as a future ownership target? |

## Boundaries

- Always:
  - treat live repo truth as authoritative
  - rerun the verification wall before making the final readiness call
  - keep Phase 6 centered on reassessment, ownership criteria, and next-planning boundary
  - separate “tests green” from “ownership decision complete”
- Ask first:
  - any code change
  - any root-plan or slice-map wording change beyond what the human explicitly requested
  - starting the follow-on ownership/import planning family
- Never:
  - treat bounded current runtime posture as automatic proof that pipeline/flow belong in Substrate
  - start ownership/import implementation inside this slice
  - reopen closed Phase 1 through Phase 5 work without concrete live regression evidence
  - call migration readiness complete while crate-by-crate ownership posture remains implicit

## Packet 6.1.2 landed matrix

Packet 6.1.2 now records the explicit crate-by-crate ownership/readiness matrix in:

- `docs/specs/handbook-engine-extraction-phase-6-slice-1-packet-6-1-2-ownership-matrix.md`

That matrix answers, for each crate:

- handbook-domain versus substrate-domain center of gravity
- whether Substrate should likely import it through a clean boundary
- whether ownership should remain handbook-side longer
- which handbook-product assumptions still matter to the call

## Packet 6.1.3 landed verdict

Final verdict: **NOT READY** for a separate ownership/integration planning family.

Verdict basis:

- Packet 6.1.1 already froze a clean committed repo posture and a green representative/full verification wall.
- Packet 6.1.2 already made every in-scope crate explicit instead of leaving ownership/readiness implicit.
- Packet 6.1.2 also records that `handbook-engine` still carries handbook-product assumptions at its current boundary (`handbook_product_canonical_layout_contract` plus charter/project-context/environment-inventory vocabulary), and the root Phase 6 checklist in `HANDBOOK_ENGINE_EXTRACTION_PLAN.md` still requires confirming `handbook-engine` is reusable without handbook-product assumptions before the repo can honestly call itself ready for the separate planning family.

### Final crate-by-crate readiness posture

| Crate | Packet 6.1.3 posture | Blocker status | Non-blocking open question or explicit deferral |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `handbook-engine` | Handbook-owned/imported, but still carrying handbook-product assumptions at the boundary. | **Blocker.** Packet 6.1.2 preserved handbook-product assumptions here, so the root Phase 6 checklist is not yet satisfied. | The unresolved question is whether a narrower earlier seam can remove or recast those assumptions cleanly enough for a later planning family, without widening into ownership/import implementation here. |
| `handbook-pipeline` | Handbook-owned/imported through the already-reviewed boundary. | No blocker. The intentionally bounded runtime wedge is still acceptable for readiness. | Keep the compiler-backed test-fixture coupling and longer-term bounded-runtime posture explicit as follow-on planning inputs, not hidden blockers. |
| `handbook-flow` | Explicitly deferred handbook-side middle layer, not a current move target. | No blocker. | The long-term ownership question stays open for the next family, but the current evidence is already clear enough to avoid blocking readiness. |
| `handbook-cli` | Handbook-owned product shell and explicitly outside any import target. | No blocker. | Any future CLI product split or redesign is deferred; it is not part of migration-readiness cleanup. |
| retained `handbook-compiler` seam | Retained handbook-side transition glue, not an import target and not the implementation center. | No blocker. | Retirement/narrowing timing remains explicitly deferred, but the seam is no longer a readiness ambiguity for Phase 6. |

### Readiness blockers

- `handbook-engine` still carries handbook-product assumptions at its current boundary, which means the root Phase 6 checklist has not yet confirmed engine reusability without handbook-product assumptions.
- No production-code regression was surfaced, but this is still a real Phase 6 blocker because the readiness rule is architectural as well as test-based.

### Non-blocking open questions

- If a narrower earlier seam removes or reframes `handbook-engine`'s remaining handbook-product assumptions, what is the smallest honest repair boundary?
- Should `handbook-pipeline` keep the current compiler-backed test fixture path longer, or should a later planning family narrow that coupling further?
- Does `handbook-flow` ever earn a future ownership move, or does it remain handbook-owned longer-term?
- Which `rendering`, `refusal`, or error-surfaces should the later ownership/integration planning family treat as explicit handbook-owned boundaries?
- When should retained `handbook-compiler` glue be narrowed or retired after the planning family is defined?

### Explicit deferrals that remain out of scope

- Authoring the follow-on ownership/integration planning family itself.
- Any production-code repair, crate move, or runtime widening.
- Any decision to move `handbook-flow`, `handbook-cli`, or retained `handbook-compiler` out of handbook ownership.
- Any retirement/narrowing work for retained `handbook-compiler` beyond documenting it as transition glue.

### Retained `handbook-compiler` readiness call

For Phase 6 readiness, retained `handbook-compiler` is temporary transition glue, not a still-blocking ownership ambiguity. The only deferred work is when and how later planning narrows or retires that glue.

## Packet 6.1.4 landed next-boundary statement

**Exact next-boundary statement:** Packet 6.1.3 is **NOT READY**, so the next planning boundary is **not** a separate ownership/integration planning family. The next honest boundary is the earlier `handbook-engine-extraction-phase-1-slice-5-layout-parameterization-closeout` seam, scoped only to parameterizing or removing the active reusable-layout assumptions still exposed at the `handbook-engine` boundary through `handbook_product_canonical_layout_contract`. The associated charter / project-context / environment-inventory canonical-layout vocabulary remains evidence for why that blocker is still visible at the boundary, or a later follow-up question, not newly authorized Slice 1.5 scope.

Why this is the right earlier seam:

- The landed Set 1 / Slice 1.5 closeout already owns the requirement that reusable internals stop carrying fixed handbook-product layout assumptions as their active contract.
- Packet 6.1.3's blocker is exactly that remaining assumption class at the `handbook-engine` boundary, not a target-definition problem, caller/compiler-ownership problem, or CLI-shell ownership problem.
- Therefore Packet 6.1.4 routes the blocker back to that narrow earlier seam and stops there; it does **not** silently reopen Set 2 / Set 3 / Set 4 and does **not** begin the later ownership/import planning family.

## Success Criteria

- The Phase 1 through Phase 5 migration gate is revalidated against live repo truth.
- The full verification wall is green, or any failure is explicitly named as a blocker.
- Each crate in the extracted workspace has an explicit ownership/readiness assessment.
- The retained `handbook-compiler` seam is described honestly as either temporary glue to retire later or as a still-blocking ambiguity.
- The slice ends with a clear readiness verdict for separate ownership/integration planning.
- The exact next planning boundary is named without beginning that follow-on work.

## Open Questions

- Should `handbook-pipeline` remain handbook-owned longer than `handbook-engine`, even if Substrate can consume it through a clean adapter boundary?
- Does `handbook-flow` ever earn a later ownership move, or is the honest long-term outcome still handbook-owned composition?
- Which parts of `rendering`, `refusal`, and `error` still need ownership clarification before a later import plan can be honest?
- At what point should retained `handbook-compiler` support glue be retired instead of remaining as a transition seam?
