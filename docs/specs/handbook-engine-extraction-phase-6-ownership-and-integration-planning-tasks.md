# Tasks: Handbook Engine Extraction Phase 6 - Ownership And Integration Planning

Plan reference: [handbook-engine-extraction-phase-6-ownership-and-integration-planning-plan.md](./handbook-engine-extraction-phase-6-ownership-and-integration-planning-plan.md)

## Status

- Packets 1, 2, and 3 are landed in this task ledger.
- This ledger remains planning-only and docs-only.
- Packet 4 is landed here as a bounded downstream seam map plus final human review gate only.
- Packet 1 verification-time repo-truth freeze (pre-landing baseline, not the later landed HEAD):
  - branch: `feat/seam-extraction`
  - pre-landing baseline HEAD: `01b50868599bc55e7680784a9b5b2dace5ab6042`
  - working tree posture at verification time: dirty only in unrelated local files `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
  - `aa882af42792a250cc02a6740bd1e2123178caff..01b50868599bc55e7680784a9b5b2dace5ab6042` is the verification-time docs-only baseline range
  - later Packet 1 docs-only commits may advance HEAD without changing the prerequisite authority truth frozen there

## Packet 1: Freeze Current Authority And Scope Guard

- [x] Task: Record the current repo-truth starting gate for this planning family
  - Acceptance: The triplet states the verification-time branch/pre-landing-baseline posture, the docs-only baseline delta from `aa882af...` to `01b5086`, and that Phase 6 Slice 1 is already READY before this family begins.
  - Verify: `git status --short --branch && git rev-parse HEAD && git log --oneline --decorate -20 && git diff --stat aa882af42792a250cc02a6740bd1e2123178caff..HEAD && git diff --name-only aa882af42792a250cc02a6740bd1e2123178caff..HEAD && rg -n "READY|Packet 6\.1\.4|ownership-and-integration-planning|default_canonical_layout_contract" docs/specs/handbook-engine-extraction-phase-6-slice-1-migration-readiness-reassessment-*.md`
  - Completion note: Recorded branch `feat/seam-extraction`, pre-landing verification baseline `01b50868599bc55e7680784a9b5b2dace5ab6042`, unrelated local dirt in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, and a docs-only `aa882af... .. 01b5086` baseline delta across nine `docs/specs/` files. Later Packet 1 docs-only commits do not change that prerequisite authority truth. The prerequisite reassessment triplet remains **READY** and Packet 6.1.4 names this family as the next planning boundary.

- [x] Task: Re-state the root ownership rule and hard planning boundaries inside the triplet
  - Acceptance: The triplet makes explicit that handbook stays owner when the center of gravity is handbook-domain, Substrate only becomes owner if the crate becomes truly substrate-specific, and implementation stays out of scope.
  - Verify: `rg -n "handbook should own it and Substrate should import it|substrate-specific|planning-only|out of scope|GitNexus impact analysis" docs/specs/handbook-engine-extraction-phase-6-ownership-and-integration-planning-{spec,plan,tasks}.md`
  - Completion note: Packet 1 froze the Phase 6 root rule, kept the landing docs-only/planning-only, and explicitly deferred later packets.

- [x] Task: Check the triplet against the prerequisite authority set and list contradictions explicitly
  - Acceptance: Any contradiction is listed explicitly; if none exist, the triplet says so plainly.
  - Verify: `rg -n "Contradictions Vs\. Prerequisite Authority Set|No contradiction found|READY gate|outside Packet 1 authority" docs/specs/handbook-engine-extraction-phase-6-ownership-and-integration-planning-{spec,plan,tasks}.md`
  - Completion note: No contradiction was found in the prerequisite authority set. Packet 1 froze the READY gate without reopening it.

## Packet 2: Decide Handbook-Owned Imported-Core Boundaries

- [x] Task: Verify the `handbook-engine` public boundary and generic default-layout truth
  - Acceptance: The triplet records that `handbook-engine` remains handbook-owned, states whether Substrate should import through the current public surface or a thinner adapter, and explicitly reflects the generic `default_canonical_layout_contract` / `CanonicalLayoutContract` truth.
  - Verify: `rg -n "pub use|pub mod|mod " crates/engine/src/lib.rs && rg -n "default_canonical_layout_contract|workspace_contract_version" crates/engine/src/lib.rs crates/engine/src/canonical_paths.rs && cargo tree -p handbook-engine && cargo test -p handbook-engine --test canonical_artifacts_ingest`
  - Completion note: `crates/engine/src/lib.rs` exposes the reusable canonical-artifact, authored-truth, validation, freshness, and layout-contract surface; `crates/engine/src/canonical_paths.rs` exports the generic `default_canonical_layout_contract()` over `CanonicalLayoutContract`; `workspace_contract_version()` remains shared workspace truth; `cargo tree -p handbook-engine` stayed foundational; and `canonical_artifacts_ingest` passed, including non-default layout-contract coverage. Packet 2 therefore records `handbook-engine` as handbook-owned imported core that Substrate may consume through the current public crate surface.

- [x] Task: Verify the `handbook-pipeline` runtime wedge and bounded compiler-backed fixture/support coupling
  - Acceptance: The triplet records that `handbook-pipeline` remains handbook-owned, states whether Substrate should import through the full public surface or only a thinner reviewed boundary, and names the residual compiler-backed fixture/support coupling honestly.
  - Verify: `rg -n "pub use|pub mod|mod " crates/pipeline/src/lib.rs && rg -n "PipelineCapture|PipelineHandoff|RouteState|template_library|stage_10_feature_spec" crates/pipeline/src crates/pipeline/tests && cargo tree -p handbook-pipeline && cargo test -p handbook-pipeline --test pipeline_catalog`
  - Completion note: `crates/pipeline/src/lib.rs` re-exports the catalog/runtime wedge directly; `cargo tree -p handbook-pipeline` shows `handbook-engine` as the runtime dependency and `handbook-compiler` only as a dev-dependency; `crates/pipeline/tests/pipeline_catalog.rs` still imports `handbook_compiler::author::template_library`; and `pipeline_catalog` passed, including the supported-target wedge checks plus declarative-source assertions. Packet 2 therefore records `handbook-pipeline` as handbook-owned external core that Substrate should import only through a thinner reviewed boundary rather than by endorsing the full crate surface as fully decoupled.

- [x] Task: Record exact repo-level boundary text for engine and pipeline without collapsing the calls together
  - Acceptance: The triplet contains separate, quote-ready boundary text for `handbook-engine` and `handbook-pipeline` and keeps their Substrate postures distinct.
  - Verify: `rg -n "handbook-owned imported core|handbook-owned external core|thinner reviewed integration boundary|current public crate surface|CanonicalLayoutContract" docs/specs/handbook-engine-extraction-phase-6-ownership-and-integration-planning-{spec,plan,tasks}.md`
  - Completion note: The docs now state that `handbook-engine` stays handbook-owned and is importable through its current public crate surface, while `handbook-pipeline` stays handbook-owned but should be consumed only through the supported-target reviewed boundary rather than the entire re-export surface.

- [x] Task: Name the deferred pipeline-specific cleanup seam explicitly and keep later packets out of scope
  - Acceptance: The triplet names the residual pipeline seam instead of hiding it in the ownership verdict and, at Packet 2 landing time, leaves Packets 3 and 4 untouched.
  - Verify: `rg -n "compiler-backed fixture/support decoupling|template_library|Packet 3|Packet 4|out of scope" docs/specs/handbook-engine-extraction-phase-6-ownership-and-integration-planning-{spec,plan,tasks}.md`
  - Completion note: Packet 2 names compiler-backed fixture/support decoupling for the catalog/runtime wedge—starting with `crates/pipeline/tests/pipeline_catalog.rs` reaching into `handbook_compiler::author::template_library`—as its own later bounded seam. At the Packet 2 landing point, Packet 3 and Packet 4 remained pending and out of scope.

## Packet 3: Decide Handbook-Side Deferred Boundaries And Non-Targets

- [x] Task: Verify the `handbook-flow` surface and lock the handbook-owned longer-term posture without overclaiming an import target
  - Acceptance: The triplet states that `handbook-flow` remains handbook-owned longer-term, treats the current crate as a handbook-side middle layer rather than a move target, and names what a future narrower import boundary would have to prove without claiming that proof already exists.
  - Verify: `rg -n "pub mod|pub use|resolve|PacketResult|BudgetOutcome" crates/flow/src/lib.rs crates/flow/src && cargo tree -p handbook-flow && cargo test -p handbook-flow --test resolver_core`
  - Completion note: `crates/flow/src/lib.rs` still exports only the `budget`, `packet_result`, and `resolver` family plus reviewed re-exports, `flow_contract_version()` still delegates to `handbook_engine::workspace_contract_version()`, `cargo tree -p handbook-flow` shows the crate sitting directly on `handbook-engine`, and `resolver_core` passed. Packet 3 therefore records `handbook-flow` as handbook-owned longer-term and requires any later narrower import boundary to prove a stable reviewed contract around the resolver / packet-result / budget family before later planning can bless it.

- [x] Task: Lock `handbook-cli` as the handbook-owned product shell and explicit non-target
  - Acceptance: The triplet states plainly that `handbook-cli` is handbook-owned product shell, not an import target, and ties that decision to live shell ownership evidence instead of vague product-language.
  - Verify: `rg -n "CommandFactory|ExitCode|pipeline_help|doctor|rendering|prompt" crates/cli/src/main.rs crates/cli/src && cargo test -p handbook-cli --test help_drift_guard`
  - Completion note: `crates/cli/src/main.rs` still owns the clap command tree, dynamic pipeline help, prompting, rendering, command dispatch, doctor/setup shell flow, and exit-code handling; the top-level about text still presents the full handbook product shell; and `help_drift_guard` passed. Packet 3 therefore records `handbook-cli` as handbook-owned product shell rather than any import target and keeps CLI redesign/product splitting out of scope.

- [x] Task: Lock retained `handbook-compiler` as transition glue rather than a future ownership target
  - Acceptance: The triplet states that retained `handbook-compiler` remains handbook-side transition glue, not the implementation center and not a future ownership target, and ties that call to the live re-export/dependency posture.
  - Verify: `rg -n "rendering|refusal|doctor|setup|template_library|pub use" crates/compiler/src/lib.rs crates/compiler/src && cargo tree -p handbook-compiler && cargo check --workspace`
  - Completion note: `crates/compiler/src/lib.rs` still re-exports author/template-library, doctor, refusal, rendering, resolver, and setup adapters while depending on `handbook-engine`, `handbook-flow`, and `handbook-pipeline`; `cargo tree -p handbook-compiler` still shows the compiler crate sitting above those extracted owner crates; and `cargo check --workspace` passed. Packet 3 therefore records retained `handbook-compiler` as handbook-side transition glue that later work may narrow or retire, but not as the future durable owner boundary.

- [x] Task: Name the deferred handbook-side support surfaces explicitly and keep Packet 4 out of scope
  - Acceptance: The triplet keeps `handbook-flow`, `handbook-cli`, and retained `handbook-compiler` distinct, explicitly names the support surfaces left to later seams, and does not drift into Packet 4 downstream execution planning.
  - Verify: `rg -n "handbook-flow|handbook-cli|handbook-compiler|rendering|refusal|error|doctor|setup|Packet 4|review gate|deferred" docs/specs/handbook-engine-extraction-phase-6-ownership-and-integration-planning-{spec,plan,tasks}.md`
  - Completion note: Packet 3 now separately records the `handbook-flow` future-proof requirement, the `handbook-cli` product-shell boundary, and the retained `handbook-compiler` transition-glue posture; it also leaves the exact `rendering` / `refusal` / error split, CLI-facing `doctor` / `setup` / template-library support adapters, retained-compiler narrowing/retirement timing, and Packet 4 downstream execution seams as explicit later seams instead of pretending they are already settled here.

## Packet 4: Define Downstream Execution Seams And Review Gate

- [x] Task: Name the bounded downstream execution seams without starting any of them
  - Acceptance: The triplet names separate follow-on seams for any later `handbook-engine` adapter / boundary-freeze work if still needed, `handbook-pipeline` boundary cleanup, `handbook-flow` ownership clarification, retained `handbook-compiler` narrowing, and CLI shell/support clarification. The triplet also routes the deferred `rendering` / `refusal` / `error` / `doctor` / `setup` / `template_library` support surfaces explicitly enough that later planning can tell which seam settles which question, while keeping Packet 1 through 3 ownership calls intact and saying plainly that Packet 4 is not execution approval.
  - Verify: `rg -n "landed in this change|already landed before this packet|rendering|refusal|error|doctor|setup|template_library|review gate|execution approval" docs/specs/handbook-engine-extraction-phase-6-ownership-and-integration-planning-{spec,plan,tasks}.md`
  - Completion note: Packet 4 now records five bounded downstream seams only: an optional later `handbook-engine` adapter / boundary-freeze seam if future review still needs it; a `handbook-pipeline` boundary cleanup seam focused on the reviewed importer boundary plus the pipeline-side compiler-backed `template_library` / fixture-support decoupling; a `handbook-flow` ownership clarification seam focused on proving or rejecting a reviewed resolver / packet-result / budget import slice plus only the bounded flow-side importer/error-boundary proof; a retained `handbook-compiler` narrowing seam focused on later transition-glue retirement/narrowing after explicit homes exist for compiler-routed compatibility helpers such as template-library authoring glue and non-shell `refusal` / `rendering` / `error` compatibility helpers outside that bounded flow proof; and a CLI shell/support clarification seam focused on shell-owned rendering/output formatting, shell-facing refusal/error presentation, `doctor`, `setup`, prompting, operator wording, and exit-code policy. Packet 1 through 3 decisions remain intact, none of those seams start here, and Packet 4 does not convert any seam into execution approval.

- [x] Task: Land the final human review gate for the planning family
  - Acceptance: The triplet states that Packet 4 ends the planning family at a human review gate; packet-prompt authoring, production edits, publication, crates.io, Substrate consumption, and integration implementation remain blocked until a human separately reviews the triplet and approves a later execution packet.
  - Verify: `rg -n "landed in this change|already landed before this packet|review gate|human review gate|execution approval|crates.io|Substrate consumption|packet-prompt authoring" docs/specs/handbook-engine-extraction-phase-6-ownership-and-integration-planning-{spec,plan,tasks}.md`
  - Completion note: Packet 4 now ends the planning family at an explicit human review gate and makes publication, crates.io, and Substrate consumption later human-reviewed decisions rather than automatic consequences of this docs landing.

## Human Review Gate

**Review gate wording:** Packet 4 ends this planning family at a human review gate. None of the downstream execution seams above start here, this packet is not execution approval, and no packet-prompt authoring, production edits, crate publication or crates.io work, Substrate consumption, or integration implementation may begin until a human separately reviews this triplet and explicitly approves a later execution packet.
