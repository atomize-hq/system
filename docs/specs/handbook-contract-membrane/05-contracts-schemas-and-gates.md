# Contracts, Schemas, and Gates

## Status

These are preliminary target contracts to be frozen by Phase 0 design slices. They are architecture authority for direction, not yet published API guarantees.

## Schema policy

- Canonical human-authored structured records use YAML where appropriate.
- YAML canonical artifacts are parsed into the JSON data model and validated by versioned JSON Schema plus separate semantic validators.
- Every structured record has a stable `schema_id` and version.
- Transport DTOs serialize to JSON and publish JSON Schema.
- OpenAPI is an optional HTTP adapter output, not the CLI/Tauri/SDK authority.
- Schema versions and semantic contract versions are explicit and independently reviewable.
- Unknown required semantics fail closed; optional extension fields require a declared extension mechanism.
- Repository-local schema references are trusted only after repo-relative/no-follow resolution and meta-schema validation; remote fetching, executable schema hooks, and ambient unversioned overrides are initially refused.

## Instance profile contract

Conceptual minimum:

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.instance-profile
schema_version: "1.1"
profile_id: default
artifact_kind_sources: []
artifact_instances: []
vocabulary: {}
context_resolution: {}
projections: []
posture_evaluation_policy_ref: null
docks: []
```

The identifier `default` is illustrative. Its artifact kinds, instances, and requiredness are not frozen until `HCM-0.6` completes research and a user brainstorming/decision session.

Required gates:

- unique stable IDs;
- valid repo-relative paths;
- exactly one constitutional-root role unless Phase 0 explicitly changes this invariant;
- dependency graph has no invalid references or cycles;
- custom artifacts reference valid schemas;
- artifact instance IDs resolve valid exact kind definitions and compatible semantic capabilities;
- vocabulary conflations are explicit;
- Resolution stack is ordered and connected;
- projection definitions reference valid source roles and target levels.

## Artifact kind definition contract

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.artifact-kind-definition
schema_version: "1.0"
kind_id: handbook.artifact-kind.charter
kind_version: "1.0.0"
canonical_schema_ref: handbook.schemas/artifacts/charter/1.0
semantic_capabilities:
  - constitutional_root
structural_validation_profile_ref: json-schema.draft-2020-12
semantic_validation_profile_ref: charter.v1
intake_definition_ref: handbook.intake/charter/1.0
projections:
  - charter.review-markdown/v1
lifecycle_policy_ref: constitutional.review-lock/v1
review_triggers:
  - production_posture_changed
  - trust_boundary_changed
required_capabilities: []
extensions: {}
```

Kind gates:

- stable kind/schema IDs and versions are unique;
- canonical schema resolves safely and passes its declared meta-schema;
- semantic capabilities are declared rather than inferred from filenames;
- projection and optional intake refs resolve compatible versions;
- repository-defined kinds pass the same definition validation as shipped kinds;
- no new Rust enum variant or CLI command is required;
- schemas contain no executable hooks or undeclared remote references.

The actual shipped kind/default-instance set is not defined by this illustrative Charter example. It is frozen only by the research and user decision in `HCM-0.6`.

## Artifact instance descriptor contract

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.artifact-instance-descriptor
schema_version: "1.0"
id: project_context
kind_ref: handbook.artifact-kind.project-context@1.0.0
role: project_context
label: Project Context
canonical_path: .handbook/project_context/project-context.yaml
required_when: always
depends_on:
  - constitutional_root
authoring:
  intake_definition_ref: null
projections:
  - project_context.review_markdown
validation_overlays: []
```

Instance gates:

- `schema_id` and `schema_version` identify the descriptor record contract independently from the referenced artifact-kind version;
- `kind_ref` resolves exactly under the selected compatibility policy;
- path, label, requiredness, and dependencies are repository-instance concerns rather than kind-definition fields;
- selected role/capabilities are supported by the referenced kind;
- dependencies resolve artifact instance IDs or declared semantic capabilities without cycles;
- overlays cannot weaken kind schema, constitutional floors, or red lines.

Custom instances use generic operations. Specialized first-party behavior must key off stable capability/role semantics, not filename matching.

## Artifact intake definition contract

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.artifact-intake-definition
schema_version: "1.0"
intake_id: handbook.intake.charter
intake_version: "1.0.0"
artifact_kind_ref: handbook.artifact-kind.charter@1.0.0
candidate_schema_ref: handbook.schemas/artifacts/charter/1.0
supported_modes:
  - guided_adaptive
  - express
  - agent_assisted
coverage:
  - coverage_id: operational_reality.production_state
    target_paths:
      - /project_conditions/production_state
    applicability: always
    acquisition:
      inferable: true
      user_declaration_required: false
      evidence_kinds:
        - repository_configuration
      freshness: session
    evaluation:
      required: true
      minimum_specificity: concrete
      contradiction_policy: block
  - coverage_id: governance.exception_approvers
    target_paths:
      - /governance/exceptions/approvers
    applicability: always
    acquisition:
      inferable: false
      user_declaration_required: true
      evidence_kinds: []
    evaluation:
      required: true
      minimum_specificity: named_role_or_owner
      contradiction_policy: block
approval_policy_ref: constitutional-candidate/v1
reassessment_triggers:
  - production_posture_changed
  - trust_boundary_changed
```

Intake gates:

- every coverage item maps to valid candidate-schema paths or an explicit rationale/evidence-only outcome;
- shorter modes cannot weaken required coverage or hide unknowns;
- inferable observations record evidence, confidence, freshness, and sensitivity;
- normative/constitutional decisions identify the authority required to approve them;
- question wording may vary by skill/projection, but stable coverage IDs and evaluation semantics do not;
- no intake definition embeds a model/provider call.

## Intake record and artifact candidate contracts

An immutable `ArtifactIntakeRecord` records:

- intake definition and acquisition mode/version;
- skill/agent/consumer identity;
- questions or coverage prompts presented;
- user declarations separately from agent inferences and deterministic defaults;
- evidence, snapshot, confidence, freshness, and sensitivity refs;
- applicability decisions, known unknowns, contradictions, waivers, and evaluation results;
- candidate and approval/promotion refs.

An `ArtifactCandidate` records:

- target kind/instance/schema refs;
- normalized candidate content or content-addressed artifact ref;
- per-field source/coverage mapping;
- validation diagnostics and unresolved gaps;
- promotion eligibility and required approver;
- candidate fingerprint.

Neither record is canonical. Promotion validates the candidate again against current kind/profile truth, records explicit approval, writes canonical YAML atomically, and emits provenance/fingerprint refs.

## Charter intake and canonical contract

`CharterIntakeDefinition` is the first rich shipped intake definition. Its coverage must account for the historical domains of project shape, delivery constraints, operational reality, posture and delivery implications, risk domains, engineering dimensions, exceptions/governance, debt, and decision records. Research/design may revise questions and branches, but omissions are explicit decisions.

Guided-adaptive, express, and agent-assisted modes all produce the same canonical Charter candidate schema. The skill-directed LLM agent conducts the conversation and invokes Handbook CLI/SDK operations; Handbook owns coverage/evaluation/promotion and performs no hidden nested synthesis.

Canonical Charter YAML owns approved constitutional truth. Intake provenance explains how it was reached. Before Phase 3, Markdown and other fixed human-review outputs are renderer-derived views; Phase-3 Resolution-aware GUI, packet, and agent-context outputs are Projections. Neither output class is an independently editable authority.

## Artifact validation layers

Do not ask one schema mechanism to own every kind of correctness:

1. **Structural schema** — fields, types, enumerations, requiredness, and local shape after YAML parsing.
2. **Semantic validation** — cross-field, cross-artifact, lifecycle, capability, and authority invariants owned by Handbook.
3. **Intake coverage evaluation** — whether required information was established with appropriate evidence, specificity, confidence, and approval.
4. **External validator docks** — domain-specific witnesses that emit normalized evidence without becoming artifact or contract authority.

A custom kind may need only structural and semantic validation. Human-authored constitutional/governance kinds commonly add intake coverage. Docks remain optional unless the kind/profile/contract requires them.

In Phase 2, a fixed deterministic first-party renderer may produce a renderer-derived human-review view only from validated canonical truth. That view accepts no Context Resolution envelope and is outside the capitalized Phase-3 `Projection` request/result/provenance contract.

## Vocabulary contract

The vocabulary schema distinguishes labels, aliases, and structural absorption:

```yaml
labels:
  coordination_horizon: phase
  delivery_unit: feature
  implementation_unit: slice
  execution_envelope: packet
  atomic_action: task
aliases:
  implementation_unit:
    - task
absorptions: []
```

Duplicate displayed labels are legal. Ambiguity matters only when a machine operation cannot resolve a stable role from the surrounding typed context.

## Context Resolution envelope

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.context-resolution-envelope
schema_version: "1.0"
active_level: execution
dimensions:
  scope_horizon: assigned_unit
  detail_resolution: normal
  temporal_horizon: immediate
  authority_horizon: local_write
  memory_horizon: execution
  validation_horizon: unit_closeout
parent_refs: []
inherited_constraint_refs: []
allowed_mutations: []
forbidden_mutations: []
escalation_triggers: []
```

Envelope gates:

- active level exists in the selected profile;
- narrower authority cannot override inherited broader constraints;
- allowed and forbidden mutation sets cannot resolve ambiguously;
- validation claims cannot exceed the validation horizon;
- memory writes above the allowed horizon require promotion evidence;
- expansion requests identify the missing context/authority condition.

## Projection request

This capitalized `Projection` request/result pair belongs only to the Phase 3 generic Resolution-aware Projection engine. A Phase 2 fixed deterministic first-party renderer produces a renderer-derived human-review view, not a Projection; it accepts no Resolution envelope and is excluded from this request/result/provenance contract. Generic configured custom-kind Projections and every Resolution-aware view are deferred until the `HCM-3.2` Context Resolution kernel and `HCM-3.3` deterministic Projection engine land.

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.projection-request
schema_version: "1.0"
artifact_refs: []
projection_id: agent.execution-packet
vocabulary_profile_ref: default
resolution_envelope: {}
surface: agent_packet
```

## Projection result

This result is Phase-3-only and is never required for a fixed pre-Phase-3 renderer-derived view.

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.projection-result
schema_version: "1.0"
projection_id: agent.execution-packet
source_refs: []
source_fingerprints: []
profile_fingerprint: ""
projection_definition_version: "1"
resolution_envelope: {}
operation: reveal
lossiness: lossless
included_claim_refs: []
omitted_claim_refs: []
derived_artifact_refs: []
promotion_eligibility: local_only
```

Allowed `operation` values initially:

- `reveal`;
- `derive`.

Reserve `synthesize_candidate` in the conceptual model but do not implement it in the first projection slice.

## Snapshot capture policy

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.snapshot-capture-policy
schema_version: "1.0"
policy_id: session-boundary.default
triggers:
  - session_start
  - session_end
state_families:
  git:
    include_paths: true
    include_diff_stats: true
    full_diff: artifact_ref_only
  handbook:
    include_profile: true
    include_artifact_fingerprints: true
    include_contract_state: true
  work:
    recent_completed:
      count: 10
      source_ref: work-ledger
      cursor: null
      ordering: completed_at_then_id
    queued_next:
      count: 10
      source_ref: active-plan
      cursor: null
      ordering: canonical_queue_order
  evidence:
    include_latest_gate_refs: true
redaction_policy_ref: snapshot-redaction.default
consistency:
  retries: 2
  unstable_action: persist_non_promotable
retention_policy_ref: snapshot-retention.session
```

For every bounded history window, `cursor: null` means start at the policy-defined initial boundary for the declared ordering. A non-null cursor is an opaque source-issued continuation position, applied exclusively so the item named by the cursor is not repeated. Reusing the same source revision, cursor, count, and ordering must select the same window; changing any of them changes capture input and therefore the policy/capture fingerprint as applicable.

Capture policy gates:

- every selected state family names its authority/source;
- bounded history windows name count, source, cursor, and ordering;
- sensitive content defaults to excluded or artifact-ref-only;
- capture hooks and retention are explicit;
- unstable captures cannot support promotion or closeout;
- changing capture policy changes its fingerprint/version.

## Context Memory Snapshot

Conceptual minimum:

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.context-memory-snapshot
schema_version: "1.0"
snapshot_id: snap_...
capture:
  trigger: session_end
  policy_ref: session-boundary.default
  started_at: "..."
  completed_at: "..."
  producer_version: "..."
  consistency: stable
  pre_revisions: {}
  post_revisions: {}
context_resolution: {}
repository:
  repository_id: "..."
  worktree_id: "..."
  branch: main
  head: "..."
  upstream: "..."
  operation_state: clean
  dirty_paths: []
  untracked_paths: []
  diff_summary: {}
  diff_artifact_refs: []
handbook:
  profile_ref: "..."
  profile_fingerprint: "..."
  artifact_kind_registry_fingerprint: "..."
  vocabulary_fingerprint: "..."
  resolution_stack_fingerprint: "..."
  artifacts: []
  intake_refs: []
  unresolved_intake_coverage: []
  posture_kernel_ref: null
  posture_recommendation_refs: []
  contracts: []
  verdict_refs: []
  gate_refs: []
work:
  active_refs: []
  recent_completed: []
  queued_next: []
  blocked_refs: []
  deferred_refs: []
  escalation_refs: []
session:
  session_ref: "..."
  handoff_ref: "..."
  dispatch_ref: "..."
evidence:
  validation_refs: []
  unresolved_proof_refs: []
redaction:
  policy_ref: snapshot-redaction.default
  excluded_surfaces: []
previous_snapshot_ref: null
state_fingerprint: sha256:...
record_fingerprint: sha256:...
promotion_eligibility: grounding_only
```

### Snapshot consistency

Supported consistency values:

- `stable` — selected authorities/revisions did not change during capture;
- `bounded` — separately captured surfaces are revision-bound and all remained within declared bounds;
- `unstable` — one or more authorities changed and the retry policy could not obtain a stable/bounded record.

An unstable snapshot remains useful for diagnostics but cannot ground a closeout, promotion, or hard gate.

### Snapshot fingerprints

- `state_fingerprint` covers normalized observed state and excludes volatile capture timestamp/trigger metadata.
- `record_fingerprint` covers the complete immutable record.
- Map keys, paths, work-item windows, and evidence refs use canonical deterministic ordering.
- Two records captured at different times may have equal state fingerprints.

### Snapshot authority

Snapshot Memory is descriptive evidence. It cannot:

- lock or mutate a contract;
- replace canonical artifacts;
- rewrite a queue or handoff;
- infer why a divergence occurred;
- pass claims beyond captured/observed state.

## Snapshot delta

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.snapshot-delta
schema_version: "1.0"
delta_id: delta_...
from_snapshot_ref: snap_previous
to_snapshot_ref: snap_current
compatibility:
  capture_policies_compatible: true
  compared_state_families: []
changes:
  git: {}
  artifacts: []
  contracts: []
  work_completed: []
  work_not_completed: []
  unplanned_work: []
  queue_changes: []
  blockers_added: []
  blockers_cleared: []
  proof_gates_gained: []
  proof_gates_lost: []
signals:
  - kind: expected_progress
    evidence_refs: []
    justification_refs: []
delta_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

Deterministic signal values:

- `expected_progress`;
- `justified_divergence`;
- `unexplained_drift`;
- `scope_expansion`;
- `execution_inefficiency_signal`;
- `planning_inaccuracy_signal`;
- `proof_drift`;
- `semantic_drift`;
- `stale_handoff`.

Signals identify evidence and durable justification refs. They do not make an unreviewed causal claim.

## Snapshot projection request/result

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.snapshot-projection-request
schema_version: "1.0"
snapshot_ref: snap_current
delta_ref: delta_previous_to_current
target_resolution_envelope: {}
purpose: session_grounding
include_families:
  - active_work
  - changed_paths
  - unresolved_blockers
  - queued_next
  - applicable_contracts
  - proof_obligations
```

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.snapshot-projection-result
schema_version: "1.0"
snapshot_ref: snap_current
snapshot_state_fingerprint: sha256:...
delta_ref: delta_previous_to_current
target_resolution_envelope: {}
included_paths: []
omitted_paths: []
grounding_data: {}
lossiness: collapsed
projection_fingerprint: sha256:...
promotion_eligibility: grounding_only
```

Projection gates:

- included fields fit the target Resolution authority and detail horizons;
- omitted sensitive or out-of-scope fields remain enumerated;
- comprehensive capture does not imply comprehensive disclosure;
- grounding projection never mutates the source snapshot;
- snapshot/delta fingerprints remain traceable;
- a new live capture or revision check detects staleness before acting.

## Snapshot redaction and retention

By default snapshots exclude:

- secret values and credential material;
- unrestricted environment variables;
- `.env` and secret-file contents;
- raw command arguments/output that may carry secrets;
- full diffs when normalized statistics/fingerprints and evidence refs suffice.

Snapshots record the redaction policy and excluded surfaces. Retention is profile/policy-driven by horizon and trigger. Immutable retained records may be content-addressed and deduplicated; compaction writes a new reviewed aggregate and never rewrites retained source snapshots.

## Project posture kernel and recommendation contracts

`ProjectPostureKernel` is a deterministic resolved result with:

- source Charter/profile/override/contract/evidence/snapshot refs and fingerprints;
- effective `EngineeringPostureDimension` levels, floors, red lines, triggers, shortcuts, and proof obligations;
- applicable domains/scopes and freshness-qualified conditions;
- resolution timestamp/revisions and kernel fingerprint;
- omitted/unresolved conditions and recommendation refs.

It is not independently editable canonical truth. Re-resolution from identical source state must produce the same kernel fingerprint.

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.posture-recommendation
schema_version: "1.0"
recommendation_id: posture_rec_...
kernel_ref: posture_kernel_...
evaluation_policy_ref: posture-policy.default/v1
affected_dimensions:
  - testing_rigor
  - rollout_controls
scope_ref: artifact.public_api
proposed_transition:
  from: 3
  to: 4
trigger_kind: hard
triggering_observations: []
evidence_refs: []
snapshot_delta_refs: []
confidence: high
urgency: before_next_release
required_approval_ref: charter.governance.project_owner
notification:
  recipient_refs: []
  acknowledgment_required: true
  escalate_after: null
suggested_actions: []
promotion_eligibility: recommendation_only
```

Recommendation gates:

- every proposal cites current kernel and observed trigger evidence;
- hard triggers and accumulated signals remain distinct;
- unexplained snapshot drift cannot silently become a causal conclusion;
- recommendations never modify canonical Charter/override state;
- lowering requires configured sustained evidence/cooldown and cannot cross floors/red lines;
- notification delivery is adapter-owned and cannot change the recommendation, acknowledgment, or approval semantics;
- acceptance writes an authorized `PostureTransition`, revalidates affected intake coverage, updates the proper canonical authority, and re-resolves the kernel.

## Optional synthesis-candidate contract

If later approved:

```yaml
operation: synthesize_candidate
producer:
  adapter: unified-agent-api
  provider_family: codex
  model: "..."
input_projection_refs: []
prompt_contract_ref: "..."
candidate_artifact_ref: "..."
promotion_eligibility: requires_review_and_lock
```

The exact UAA model/provider contract is loaded from the live `unified-agent-api` repository only for that future slice.

## Development orchestration contracts

These contracts govern development of Handbook through this control pack. They do not define a Handbook product-runtime agent engine.

### Dispatch execution envelope

The only normative current machine example is
`handoffs/internal-dispatch-template.json`. It is validated against
`handoffs/internal-dispatch.v1.1.schema.json` by `validate_handoffs.py`; do not
maintain a second partial YAML shape that can drift from the schema. Every
current internal dispatch includes the complete identity and timing fields,
parent and source lineage, execution contract, ordered skill chain, explicit
phase/slice/packet authority, replayable subject manifest, active Resolution,
authority and repo-truth statements, bounded scope/tasks/gates/stops, and the
complete structured return contract.

`execution_target` is one of:

- `internal_subagent` — default for delegable implementation, documentation, proof, remediation, and review work; the active parent executes it immediately through built-in subagent tools;
- `top_level_resume` — used only when a genuine context/runtime or authorization boundary requires another top-level task;
- `human_interactive` — used only when the next action requires user judgment, interactive observation, approval, or another non-delegable human action.

Rules:

1. `internal_subagent` uses the built-in fresh `default` agent capability with isolated context; shell-launched Codex processes, background jobs, temporary-file reviewer transport, and filesystem polling do not satisfy it.
2. Every dispatch declares an ordered `required_skills` chain beginning with `using-agent-skills`; the resolved skill workflows are mandatory, not advisory labels.
3. Review agents are read-only and receive authority, diff/evidence, gates, and non-goals without implementation reasoning or prior reviewer conclusions.
4. Internal agents return structured results to the parent and never append the global handoff ledger.
5. The parent validates findings against live truth, remediates valid findings directly or through a fresh fix agent, reruns verification, and sends the resulting state to a different fresh reviewer.
6. The parent owns integration, control-pack truth, final proof, commit, and top-level closeout.

### Parent-owned delegated-run evidence

New top-level handoffs record each proof-relevant built-in delegation:

```json
{
  "run_id": "review-round-1",
  "dispatch_id": "20260714T120000Z--HCM-0-1--independent-review",
  "dispatch_ref": "docs/specs/handbook-contract-membrane/handoffs/dispatches/20260714T120000Z--HCM-0-1--independent-review.json",
  "dispatch_fingerprint": "sha256:...",
  "role": "review",
  "agent_id": "independent_review",
  "agent_type": "default",
  "fresh_context": true,
  "required_skills": ["using-agent-skills", "code-review-and-quality"],
  "subject_fingerprint": "sha256:...",
  "result_subject_fingerprint": "sha256:...",
  "review_round": 1,
  "predecessor_run_id": null,
  "remediation_for_run_ids": [],
  "final_status": "completed",
  "verdict": "clean",
  "finding_refs": [],
  "evidence_refs": ["docs/specs/handbook-contract-membrane/handoffs/dispatches/...json"]
}
```

Handoff schema v1.2 adds required `orchestration_id`, `source_handoff_ids`, `delegation_capability`, `delegated_runs`, typed `remediations`, `reviewed_state`, `stop_reason`, and `resume`. `stop_reason` is one of `completed`, `human_input`, `external_blocker`, `authority_boundary`, `context_boundary`, or `capability_unavailable`.

A v1.2 handoff with `status: completed` must use `stop_reason: completed`, contain a completed clean fresh review run bound to `reviewed_state.subject_fingerprint` and its replayable manifest, and require no top-level resume. Human, external, authority, context, and capability stop reasons map to explicit permitted status/resume targets; v1.2 cannot emit historical `review_required`. A `capability_unavailable` stop is `blocked`. Dispatch/result parent, slice, packet, role, skills, and subject fingerprints must match. Earlier records and schemas remain immutable historical evidence.

The subject manifest sorts repository-relative paths and encodes each entry as `path + NUL + lowercase SHA-256 + newline`; the aggregate is SHA-256 over the concatenated encoded entries. Dispatch validation always recomputes the aggregate from the stored entries. At execution, the parent and reviewer verify every entry against the live subject. A completed v1.2 closeout verifies the final clean manifest against `reviewed_state.baseline_head`, the primary reviewed commit, while ledger parity is validated separately against the post-closeout record set. This preserves exact review binding even when the mechanical second commit adds the parent record and rebuilds `ledger.jsonl`. Earlier review manifests remain immutable identities of superseded pre-remediation subjects and are not incorrectly compared with the later repaired tree.

`delegation_capability.status: unavailable` and `stop_reason: capability_unavailable` are bidirectionally coupled. Unavailable mandatory delegation cannot be hidden under a human, external, authority, or context stop reason.

Every findings review in a completed closeout has a typed remediation record. Its owner is either `parent_orchestrator` with durable evidence or a completed delegated `remediation` run. The remediation names the findings run, result fingerprint, and different-fresh completed re-review run. That re-review may itself report findings; if it does, it receives its own typed remediation and another different fresh review. The last completed review must be clean. Failed or wrong-role work cannot satisfy remediation lineage.

### Review choreography

```text
implement or document
  -> verify
  -> fresh read-only reviewer
      -> clean: proof wall and closeout
      -> actionable findings:
           validate findings
           -> parent repair or fresh remediation agent
           -> verify
           -> different fresh reviewer
           -> repeat until clean or genuinely blocked
```

The orchestrator may not self-approve. A dispatch artifact proves a bounded job was specified; only captured built-in agent identity/status plus reconciled results prove that the job was executed.

## SDK command contract

Every ordinary use case has:

- a typed request;
- a typed result;
- structured expected blocked/refused states;
- a stable operation identifier;
- schema and capability versions;
- deterministic serialization.

Snapshot use cases should include capture, compare/delta, project, inspect, and verify-current operations without forcing callers to parse git or handoff prose themselves.

Artifact/intake use cases should include kind/instance discovery, structural/semantic validation, coverage inspection, evidence/declaration submission, candidate validation, promotion, projection, posture inspection, and recommendation acknowledgment. Operation IDs remain generic and select kind/instance IDs; custom kinds and vocabulary never create or rename CLI commands.

Proposed common response envelope:

```json
{
  "schema_id": "handbook.command-response",
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "operation": "contract.verify",
  "status": "ok",
  "data": {},
  "diagnostics": [],
  "next_actions": [],
  "artifact_refs": [],
  "provenance": {}
}
```

Status values:

- `ok`;
- `blocked`;
- `refused`;
- `error`.

Domain verdicts such as contract `fail` remain inside `data`; they are not collapsed into process/transport failure.

## CLI JSON contract

For every nontrivial command in JSON mode:

1. stdout contains exactly one complete JSON response document;
2. human progress and logs use stderr;
3. expected blocked/refused outcomes still serialize the envelope;
4. exit codes are stable and separately documented;
5. no ANSI styling appears in JSON;
6. large/binary outputs use artifact references;
7. the response reports capability/schema versions;
8. human output renders from the same typed result.

The initial Substrate CLI bridge consumes this contract only. It never parses human text.

## Contract record

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.contract
schema_version: "1.0"
contract_id: example.operation.v1
kind: operation
status: locked
authority_resolution: coordination
subject: {}
claims: []
required_evidence: []
scoring: {}
```

Lifecycle target:

```text
draft -> review_ready -> locked -> active -> passed|blocked -> closed
                                  \-> deprecated
```

Lifecycle transitions require typed evidence and authority. A rendered document or passing test cannot lock or close a contract by itself.

## Evidence record

Evidence identifies:

- contract and claim refs;
- producer/dock identity and version;
- subject and case;
- observed facts;
- artifact/trace refs;
- source fingerprints;
- Context Resolution envelope;
- included and unobserved claims;
- execution provenance;
- confidence/flakiness where applicable.
- snapshot and delta refs when point-in-time state supports the observation.

## Verdict contract

Supported verdicts:

- `pass`;
- `fail`;
- `blocked`;
- `warning`;
- `not_observed`;
- `not_applicable`;
- `flaky`.

Rules:

- hard-fail severity blocks regardless of aggregate score;
- required `not_observed` cannot become pass through weighting;
- evidence outside the required Resolution/subject boundary cannot satisfy a claim;
- flaky evidence remains visible and cannot silently average into green;
- verdicts cite evidence records.

## Gate contract

A gate identifies:

- target contract and lifecycle transition;
- claim verdicts;
- hard blockers;
- weighted score if used;
- local closeout eligibility;
- parent promotion eligibility;
- remediation/next actions;
- evidence and projection refs.
- snapshot/delta refs used for grounding, staleness, or drift decisions.

Local completion and broader promotion are separate decisions.

```json
{
  "schema_id": "handbook.dock-capability",
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "dock_id": "example.validator",
  "dock_protocol_versions": ["1.0"],
  "contract_kinds": ["operation"],

  },
  "execution": {
    "mode": "process",
    "supports_timeout": true,
    "supports_cancellation": true
  }
}
```

## Dock request/result

Request includes:

- protocol and schema versions;
- contract and selected claim refs;
- Resolution envelope;
- canonical/projection/evidence artifact refs;
- snapshot/delta refs when the validator needs a point-in-time state boundary;
- workspace capability grant;
- timeout/cancellation policy;
- requested evidence types.

Result includes:

- dock identity/version;
- structured status/refusal;
- normalized evidence refs;
- observed/unobserved claim refs;
- diagnostics;
- produced artifact refs;
- exact Resolution/provenance;
- execution timing and completion state.

## Public API proof gates

### CLI bridge gate

- exact Handbook binary version;
- exact JSON schema/capability versions;
- real Substrate seam;
- no human-output parsing;
- explicit replacement boundary.

### Published Rust API gate

A downstream-intended API is complete only when:

1. relevant crates are published to crates.io;
2. a registry-only external consumer resolves exact versions;
3. a dedicated Substrate worktree from current tip imports those exact versions;
4. a real seam uses the API;
5. the proof wall passes;
6. no sibling-path or unpublished fallback exists.

The CLI bridge may ship earlier, but it cannot satisfy this Rust API gate.

## Schema compatibility posture

This greenfield program does not promise compatibility with legacy Handbook artifact formats.

Compatibility rules apply only after a new schema/API is deliberately published as supported. Temporary internal cutover types must name their deletion gate and cannot become implicit public contracts.
