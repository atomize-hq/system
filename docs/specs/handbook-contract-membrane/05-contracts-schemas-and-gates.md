# Contracts, Schemas, and Gates

## Status

The HCM-0.2 sections are frozen design contracts: schema policy, instance-profile composition for stable-role/schema/kind/instance/vocabulary truth, stable-role and schema registries, artifact kinds, artifact instances, intake records/candidates/promotion, Charter/constitutional-root semantics, validation layers, vocabulary, and the project-posture owner/transition boundary. HCM-0.3 additionally freezes the Context Resolution stack/envelope/escalation/promotion, deterministic Projection definition/request/result, Snapshot Memory capture/record/delta/projection, and redaction/retention contracts. They are implementation authority for later slice packets, not published API guarantees or evidence that the runtime types exist.

SDK/transport, contract/dock, and public-API sections remain preliminary until their named Phase 0 slices close. The shipped artifact-kind/default-instance/requiredness set and shipped Resolution labels/default policy remain unresolved rather than being selected by illustrative examples.

## Schema policy

- Canonical human-authored structured records use YAML where appropriate.
- YAML canonical artifacts are parsed into the JSON data model and validated by versioned JSON Schema plus separate semantic validators.
- Every structured record has a stable `schema_id` and version.
- Transport DTOs serialize to JSON and publish JSON Schema.
- OpenAPI is an optional HTTP adapter output, not the CLI/Tauri/SDK authority.
- Schema versions and semantic contract versions are explicit and independently reviewable.
- Unknown required semantics fail closed; optional extension fields require a declared extension mechanism.
- Repository-local schema references are trusted only after repo-relative/no-follow resolution and meta-schema validation; remote fetching, executable schema hooks, and ambient unversioned overrides are initially refused.
- First-version schema, kind, stable-role registry, intake, renderer, capability-contract, posture-trigger/policy, and profile-parent references are exact ID/version references with their required semantic fingerprints. Version ranges, implicit latest selection, and undeclared fallback are refused.
- Canonical normalization and fingerprints exclude absolute machine paths, timestamps unless time is itself semantic input, and presentation-only ordering. They include every semantic value and exact referenced definition fingerprint.

### Uniform exact-definition identity

Every HCM-0.2/HCM-0.3 versioned definition uses a namespaced stable identity field and SemVer field. Its exact ref is mechanically `identity + "@" + version`; for example, `profile_id: handbook.profile.example` plus `profile_version: "1.0.0"` yields `handbook.profile.example@1.0.0`. A ref that cannot be derived this way, resolves to different identity fields, or resolves more than one record is invalid.

Every such definition also exposes one derived fingerprint field named by its contract (`profile_fingerprint`, `entry_fingerprint`, `registry_fingerprint`, `definition_fingerprint`, `capability_fingerprint`, `intake_definition_fingerprint`, `vocabulary_fingerprint`, `trigger_fingerprint`, `policy_fingerprint`, or another explicitly declared `*_fingerprint`). The common derivation is:

1. parse YAML into the JSON data model;
2. remove only the definition's own derived fingerprint field and fields explicitly classified as presentation-only by its matrix;
3. resolve every exact referenced definition and include its recomputed fingerprint in a typed closure entry, failing on a missing producer, mismatch, cycle, or duplicate identity;
4. sort object keys; preserve semantically ordered arrays; sort arrays declared unordered by their stable identity key;
5. serialize as UTF-8 RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme bytes and emit lowercase `sha256:<64-hex>`.

Type-specific matrices may add closure inputs but may not weaken this base. A referenced renderer, lifecycle policy, semantic validator, approval policy, freshness policy, signal, or evidence requirement is admissible even when its later behavioral contract is not yet frozen only if its exact versioned definition already satisfies this identity/fingerprint envelope. Changed bytes behind the same exact ref must change the recomputed fingerprint and invalidate every stale consumer. Bare refs, caller-trusted fingerprints, and versioned records with no fingerprint producer fail closed.

## Instance profile contract

Conceptual minimum:

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.instance-profile
schema_version: "1.0"
profile_id: handbook.profile.example

```

This is one internally consistent illustrative authored profile, not a proposed shipped profile. Its artifact kind, instance, label, path, renderer selection, and requiredness are examples only and do not freeze the shipped set; that decision remains reserved until `HCM-0.6` completes research and a user brainstorming/decision session.

Required gates:

- unique stable IDs;
- exact parent/source refs with an acyclic profile inheritance chain;
- one exact stable-role registry ref/fingerprint pair shared by every resolved kind and vocabulary record;
- one of `shipped`, `named`, or `repository` scope, with parent scope ordered no narrower than child scope;
- valid repo-relative paths;
- exactly one `always`-required instance selecting the `constitutional_root` capability;
- dependency graph has no invalid references or cycles;
- custom artifacts reference valid schemas;
- artifact instance IDs resolve valid exact kind definitions, stable roles, and compatible semantic capabilities;
- vocabulary conflations are explicit;
- Resolution stack is ordered and connected;
- every projection definition resolves exactly from the profile catalog; its typed source selectors, target schema, allowed surfaces/operations, mandatory currentness, exact disclosure policy/support evaluator, and per-rule six-dimension/classification closure validate against the resolved profile's registered kinds, capabilities, schemas, and exact Context Resolution selection.

Field authority/defaulting matrix:

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_id`, `schema_version` | Handbook record-schema registry identifies the profile record shape | none | exact supported pair | not the profile's semantic version |
| `profile_id`, `profile_version` | profile author identifies one versioned semantic configuration | none | stable ID plus SemVer; unique tuple | no implicit `default` or latest profile |
| `profile_scope` | profile author declares `shipped`, `named`, or `repository` layer scope | none | allowlisted value; ancestry order is shipped -> named -> repository | not runtime authority horizon |
| `extends_profile_ref` | profile author selects one exact parent | `null` | exact resolvable ref; acyclic | no ambient or multi-parent merge |
| `stable_role_registry.ref`/fingerprint | stable-role registry owns role IDs/default labels; profile author selects exact semantics | root: required; child omission inherits; present pair replaces whole | exact versioned ref; supplied fingerprint matches; every kind/vocabulary pair is identical | no ambient registry or label drift |
| `schema_registry_sources` | profile author supplies a complete ordered source list when present | root: required; child omission inherits; present list replaces whole; explicit empty clears | exact refs; unique identities; conflicts within replacement fail | no append merge or remote discovery |
| `artifact_kind_sources` | profile author supplies a complete ordered kind-source list when present | root: required; child omission inherits; present list replaces whole; explicit empty clears | exact refs; unique identities; conflicts within replacement fail | no append merge or enum/template inference |
| `artifact_instances` | profile author supplies a complete instance registry when present | root: required; child omission inherits; present list replaces whole; explicit empty clears and then fails final constitutional validation | unique IDs/paths; valid kinds/roles/capabilities/requiredness/dependencies | no keyed merge/tombstone or reusable kind authority |
| `vocabulary_ref` | profile author selects one exact vocabulary profile | root: required; child omission inherits; present value replaces | resolves and validates | does not rename machine identifiers or commands |
| `context_resolution_ref` | Context Resolution stack-definition author owns comparison/default semantics; profile author selects one exact definition | root: required exact ref; child omission inherits; present ref replaces | exact ref/fingerprint closure; ordered connected levels; all six ranked domains/defaults complete | not an invocation override or a fixed L0-L3 mapping |
| `projection_catalog_refs` | Projection-definition authors own deterministic mapping semantics; profile author selects a complete compatible catalog | root: explicit list, which may be empty; child omission inherits; present list replaces whole | exact unique refs/fingerprints; sources, surfaces, schemas, derivations, disclosure policies/support evaluators/classifications/minimum ranks, and stack compatibility resolve | fixed renderer refs and executable hooks do not belong here |
| `posture_evaluation_policy` | profile author selects an approved policy ref/fingerprint pair | root: exact pair or `null`; child omission inherits; present pair/null replaces | exact compatible current policy fingerprint | null disables recommendations; no automatic Charter mutation |
| `dock_requirement_refs` | later HCM-0.5 authority | root: explicit empty; child omission inherits; present list replaces whole | exact refs after later contract lands | no executable validator in a profile |
| `adapter_overlay_refs` | adapter/profile integration authority | root: explicit empty; child omission inherits; present list replaces whole | exact declared refs; cannot change domain truth | no transport-owned semantics |
| `extensions` | declaring schema owns namespaced optional additions | root: explicit map; child omission inherits; present map replaces whole | registered namespace and optional-field rules | no key merge or unknown required semantics |
| `profile_fingerprint` | Handbook derives immutable source-layer identity | none; derived for every source profile | uniform exact-definition normalization over authored fields except this fingerprint; referenced definitions are pinned by their exact refs/fingerprints | not the fully resolved profile fingerprint |

All authored fields after `extends_profile_ref` through `extensions` are optional in a child source record specifically so omission and explicit empty/null remain distinguishable. Root profiles materialize every authored field, and every source profile carries a derived `profile_fingerprint`. No v1 invocation request may override these fields; invocation selects an exact profile ref only.

This is a generic conformance example, not a shipped profile/default decision.

| Resolved field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| schema identity and `profile_ref` | Handbook resolver identifies the derived record and selected exact source profile | none | exact supported schema; source profile exists | resolved view is not editable profile authority |
| `ancestry` | resolver records ordered source identity/fingerprint chain | none; at least selected profile | exact refs/fingerprints; acyclic; legal scope order | no hidden/ambient layer |
| `stable_role_registry` | winning profile layer selects exact role semantics; registry remains authority | none | exact ref/fingerprint; every kind/vocabulary pair matches; all role refs resolve | no ambient registry/default label |
| `schema_registry_entries` | resolver materializes schema definitions and document closures from the winning complete source field | empty only if no kind needs a schema | unique exact refs; current entry fingerprints plus safe document closure fingerprints | a document-only closure fingerprint cannot stand in for definition identity; no source-order conflict repair |
| `artifact_kind_definitions` | resolver materializes exact kinds and fingerprints | empty only if no instance exists | unique exact kinds; all instance refs resolve | no inferred enum kinds |
| `artifact_instances` | winning profile layer remains configuration authority; resolver materializes full descriptors | none; final list must be explicit | all descriptor gates plus exactly one constitutional capability | no keyed merge/tombstone |
| `vocabulary` | winning vocabulary record remains display/workflow mapping authority | none | exact ref/fingerprint and vocabulary gates | no capability/command renaming |
| `context_resolution` | winning `context_resolution_ref` layer selects exact stack semantics; resolver materializes its pair | none | exact ref/fingerprint; ordered levels, six ranked domains, and defaults resolve | no ambient stack, fixed L0-L3 inference, or invocation mutation |
| `projection_catalog` | winning `projection_catalog_refs` layer selects a complete catalog; resolver materializes pairs | explicit list, which may be empty | exact compatible refs/fingerprints; every advertised kind/instance Projection and its disclosure-policy/support-evaluator/classification/rank closure resolves through the catalog and exact profile stack | no fixed renderer, ambient disclosure/support registry, or dynamic executable behavior |
| remaining later-phase refs/lists | their named profile field/later contract owns them | explicit null/empty as shown until later freezes | later contract compatibility | no premature dock behavior |
| `posture_evaluation_policy` | winning profile layer selects policy ref/fingerprint pair | explicit pair or null | compatible exact current policy | null disables recommendations, not policy authority |
| `adapter_overlay_refs` | winning profile layer selects declared overlays | explicit list | exact refs cannot change domain truth | no transport-owned semantics |
| `extensions` | winning profile layer supplies complete namespaced map | explicit map | declared optional namespaces | no key merge/unknown required semantics |
| `layer_decisions` | resolver explains the winning source for every layerable field | none; one decision per field | exact ancestry source and `inherited` or `replaced` disposition | diagnostics do not change authority |
| `diagnostics` | resolver records deterministic warnings/refusals | empty on clean resolution | typed, stable ordering | no silent conflict repair |
| `resolved_profile_fingerprint` | Handbook derives complete semantic identity | none | normalized record plus stable-role registry and every exact definition fingerprint; excludes diagnostics, absolute paths, timestamps, invocation requests | no caller-supplied trust |

Profile conformance scenarios required by implementation packets:

| Scenario | Required result |
|---|---|
| child omits a field | inherits the complete parent value and records `inherited` |
| child supplies a field | replaces the complete parent value and records `replaced` |
| child supplies empty instances or removes constitutional capability | final resolution refuses; no tombstone semantics |
| replacement list contains duplicate/conflicting schema, kind, instance, or path identities | refuses without source-order fallback |
| repository layer replaces paths/requiredness | allowed only as a complete versioned replacement that passes every descriptor/constitutional gate |
| invocation attempts field mutation | refuses; invocation may select only an exact profile plus operation DTO fields |
| same layer bytes/definition fingerprints resolve twice | identical resolved-profile fingerprint and ordered decisions |
| selected role-registry bytes change behind the same ref | stale fingerprint refuses; a new fingerprint changes resolved-profile and vocabulary-default identity |

## Schema registry entry contract

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.schema-registry-entry
schema_version: "1.0"
content_schema_id: handbook.schemas.artifacts.charter
content_schema_version: "1.0.0"
document_ref: handbook.schemas/artifacts/charter/1.0.0.schema.json
document_fingerprint: sha256:...
closure_fingerprint: sha256:...
meta_schema_ref: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema
media_type: application/schema+json
compatibility: exact
extensions: {}
entry_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_id`, `schema_version` | Handbook record-schema registry identifies the entry shape | none | exact supported pair | not the content schema identity |
| `content_schema_id`, `content_schema_version` | schema author owns structural schema identity | none | stable ID plus SemVer; unique tuple | no filename-derived identity |
| `document_ref` | schema entry owns local resolution | none | normalized repository-relative regular file; no-follow; inside allowed roots | no URL/network fetch |
| `document_fingerprint` | Handbook derives content identity from exact bytes | none; recomputed on load | lowercase SHA-256 matches resolved document | no trust in a caller-supplied digest alone |
| `closure_fingerprint` | Handbook derives structural-schema closure identity | none | uniform hash over root document and every transitively resolved local `$ref` document fingerprint in deterministic ref order | no omitted or remote dependency |
| `meta_schema_ref` | Handbook schema policy selects the validator dialect | Draft 2020-12 only in v1 | exact allowlisted meta-schema; document passes it | no executable custom meta-schema hook |
| `media_type` | schema entry declares parser expectations | `application/schema+json` | exact allowlisted value | canonical artifact YAML is not the schema document format |
| `compatibility` | Handbook version policy owns resolution posture | `exact` | only `exact` is valid in v1 | no range/latest fallback |
| `extensions` | declaring schema owns namespaced optional additions | empty | declared namespace | no unknown required behavior |
| `entry_fingerprint` | Handbook derives exact versioned registry-entry identity | none | uniform exact-definition fingerprint including document/closure fingerprints | no caller-supplied or document-only identity |

Registry gates:

- `(content_schema_id, content_schema_version)` resolves to exactly one document and fingerprint;
- conflicting sources for the same tuple fail closed rather than using source order to mask drift;
- every local `$ref` follows the same normalized repo-relative/no-follow policy and participates in the resolved fingerprint closure;
- remote `$ref`, executable formats/hooks, unresolved refs, symlink escapes, and byte/fingerprint mismatch are refused;
- passing structural schema validation does not satisfy semantic validation, intake coverage, approval, or a contract gate.

## Stable-role registry contract

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.stable-role-registry
schema_version: "1.0"
registry_id: handbook.roles.core
registry_version: "1.0.0"
roles:
  - role_id: constitutional_authority
    canonical_display_label: Constitutional Authority
    category: governance
  - role_id: project_context
    canonical_display_label: Project Context
    category: artifact
  - role_id: coordination_horizon
    canonical_display_label: Coordination Horizon
    category: workflow
  - role_id: delivery_unit
    canonical_display_label: Delivery Unit
    category: workflow
  - role_id: implementation_unit
    canonical_display_label: Implementation Unit
    category: workflow
  - role_id: execution_envelope
    canonical_display_label: Execution Envelope
    category: workflow
  - role_id: atomic_action
    canonical_display_label: Atomic Action
    category: workflow
registry_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_id`, `schema_version` | Handbook record-schema registry identifies registry shape | none | exact supported pair | not the role-registry semantic version |
| `registry_id`, `registry_version` | Handbook stable-role authority identifies one immutable version | none | stable ID plus SemVer; unique tuple | no implicit core/latest registry |
| `roles[].role_id` | stable-role authority owns machine identity | none; at least one | stable and unique within registry | vocabulary cannot add/rename a role |
| `roles[].canonical_display_label` | stable-role authority supplies deterministic fallback display text | none | non-empty normalized display string | not a profile-selected label |
| `roles[].category` | stable-role authority classifies legal uses/absorptions | none | `artifact`, `workflow`, `governance`, `evidence`, or `organizational` | category does not grant a capability |
| `registry_fingerprint` | Handbook derives exact registry identity | none | SHA-256 over normalized registry fields except this fingerprint | no mutable registry behind a stable ref |

Profiles select exactly one registry ref/fingerprint pair. Every resolved kind and vocabulary record must cite that same pair. Unknown roles, mismatched registry versions/fingerprints, category-invalid absorptions, and changed bytes behind an unchanged ref fail closed. Exact selection, not process-global code, determines canonical fallback labels and role validation.

## Artifact kind definition contract

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.artifact-kind-definition
schema_version: "1.0"

```

Kind gates:

- stable kind/schema IDs and versions are unique;
- canonical schema resolves safely and passes its declared meta-schema;
- semantic capabilities cite exact contracts and valid schema bindings rather than being inferred from filenames;
- fixed renderer and future Projection refs are distinct and resolve compatible exact versions; intake definitions target kinds in the opposite direction and are not kind fields;
- repository-defined kinds pass the same definition validation as shipped kinds;
- no new Rust enum variant or CLI command is required;
- schemas contain no executable hooks or undeclared remote references.

The actual shipped kind/default-instance set is not defined by this illustrative Charter example. It is frozen only by the research and user decision in `HCM-0.6`.

`definition_fingerprint` is derived over the normalized kind record plus the stable-role registry fingerprint and the resolved fingerprints of its schema, capability contracts, semantic validators, renderer definitions, lifecycle policy, and declared extension schemas. It does not include or reference intake definitions; intake definitions point to kinds. It is emitted on the validated definition and excluded from its own hash; authors do not choose it.

### Semantic capability contract

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.semantic-capability-contract
schema_version: "1.0"
contract_id: handbook.capabilities.constitutional-root
contract_version: "1.0.0"
capability_id: constitutional_root
required_bindings:
  - policy_root
  - policy_revision
  - decision_authority
  - required_approvals
  - exception_policy
  - engineering_posture_dimensions
  - red_lines
  - review_triggers
  - reassessment_triggers
semantic_validation_profile_refs:
  - handbook.semantic-validation.constitutional-root@1.0.0
allowed_instance_cardinality: exactly_one
extensions: {}
capability_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_id`, `schema_version` | Handbook record-schema registry identifies capability-contract shape | none | exact supported pair | not capability semantic identity |
| `contract_id`, `contract_version` | Handbook semantic registry identifies one exact versioned contract definition | none | namespaced ID plus SemVer; exact ref derives as `contract_id@contract_version`; unique tuple | no implicit latest or ID reconstruction |
| `capability_id` | Handbook semantic registry owns stable capability meaning selected by instances | none | registered stable capability ID; contract ref resolves this same ID | no user label/filename authority |
| `required_bindings` | capability contract owns required semantic slots | none | unique registered binding keys | does not prescribe one artifact schema layout |
| `semantic_validation_profile_refs` | capability contract owns conformance invariants | none for constitutional authority | exact built-in/declarative refs | no repository executable hook |
| `allowed_instance_cardinality` | capability contract owns resolved-profile cardinality | explicit | `exactly_one` or `at_least_one`; `constitutional_root` is `exactly_one` | not artifact-kind or shipped-default cardinality |
| `extensions` | capability schema owns namespaced optional additions | empty | declared namespace/schema | no unknown required behavior |
| `capability_fingerprint` | Handbook derives exact capability-contract identity | none | uniform exact-definition fingerprint including every semantic-validator fingerprint | no stable ref with mutable contract meaning |

A kind's `semantic_capabilities[].bindings` must provide every required binding as a valid JSON Pointer into the exact canonical content schema. Required slots may map to differently named/schema-shaped fields, but the declared semantic validators must prove the capability invariants. This is how custom kinds can conform without copying Charter's filename or schema layout.

V1 cardinality has exactly two values. `exactly_one` requires one distinct resolved provider instance. `at_least_one` requires one or more and resolves the complete provider set in stable instance-ID order; it never chooses one provider implicitly. A kind may contain at most one `semantic_capabilities` entry for a capability ID. Multiple registry versions may exist, but a kind selection or dependency always cites one exact contract version, and the capability ID in the contract must match. Duplicate declarations, zero providers, excess providers for `exactly_one`, mismatched versions, and any definition-closure cycle fail closed.

## Artifact instance descriptor contract

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.artifact-instance-descriptor
schema_version: "1.0"
id: project_context
kind_ref: handbook.artifact-kind.project-context@1.0.0
role_ref: project_context
capability_refs: []
label: Project Context
canonical_path: .handbook/project_context/project-context.yaml
requiredness:
  mode: always
  condition_ref: null
depends_on:
  - target_kind: capability
    target_ref: constitutional_root
    target_contract_ref: handbook.capabilities.constitutional-root@1.0.0
    cardinality: exactly_one
lifecycle_policy_ref: null
intake_definition_ref: null
renderer_definition_refs:
  - handbook.renderer.project-context-review-markdown@1.0.0
projection_definition_refs: []
validation_overlay_refs: []
extensions: {}
```

Instance gates:

- `schema_id` and `schema_version` identify the descriptor record contract independently from the referenced artifact-kind version;
- `kind_ref` resolves exactly;
- path, label, requiredness, and dependencies are repository-instance concerns rather than kind-definition fields;
- selected `role_ref` is supported by the kind and every selected `capability_ref` has a kind capability contract;
- dependencies resolve exact instance IDs or exact semantic-capability contracts without cycles, source-order fallback, or ambiguous provider selection;
- overlays cannot weaken kind schema, constitutional floors, or red lines.

Custom instances use generic operations. Specialized first-party behavior must key off stable capability/role semantics, not filename matching.

The `project_context` descriptor above is a shape example only. It does not select a shipped kind, instance, path, label, renderer, or requiredness decision.

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_id`, `schema_version` | Handbook record-schema registry identifies descriptor shape | none | exact supported pair | not kind schema identity |
| `id` | profile author owns repository instance identity | none | unique stable ID | no filename-derived identity |
| `kind_ref` | profile author selects reusable kind | none | exact resolvable kind and definition fingerprint | no version range/latest fallback |
| `role_ref` | profile author selects one stable semantic role | explicit registered value or explicit `null` | referenced kind lists the role in `supported_role_refs` | role selection does not grant a capability |
| `capability_refs` | profile author selects behavioral/conformance capabilities exposed by the kind | explicit list, possibly empty | unique registered IDs; kind supplies each exact capability contract/binding | capability IDs are not vocabulary roles |
| `label` | profile vocabulary/presentation authority owns instance display text | none | non-empty display string | does not rename ID, path, schema, command, or capability |
| `canonical_path` | profile author owns concrete repository placement | none | normalized repo-relative no-follow path; unique among instances; no template remains after resolution | no absolute path or filename dispatch |
| `requiredness.mode` | profile author owns `always`, `conditional`, or `optional` | none | allowlisted enum; constitutional root is `always` | no inference from current setup/templates |
| `requiredness.condition_ref` | profile author selects deterministic project-condition truth | `null` unless mode is `conditional` | exact condition ref; required iff conditional | no arbitrary expression/script |
| `depends_on[].target_kind` | profile author selects dependency namespace | empty dependency list; no per-entry default | `instance` or `capability` | no ambiguous bare string |
| `depends_on[].target_ref` | profile author selects exact instance ID or registered capability ID | none per entry | matches target namespace and resolves | no filename dependency |
| `depends_on[].target_contract_ref` | profile author binds a capability dependency to one exact contract | exact ref when `target_kind=capability`; explicit `null` when `instance` | contract capability ID matches `target_ref`; every provider exposes that exact contract | no compatible-range or source-order provider selection |
| `depends_on[].cardinality` | profile author declares required target count | none per entry | `exactly_one` or `at_least_one` for capability; only `exactly_one` for unique instance ID; acyclic and satisfiable | not artifact requiredness or an implicit provider choice |
| `lifecycle_policy_ref` | profile author selects instance policy override | explicit exact ref or `null` | compatible with kind; cannot weaken kind/constitutional policy | not current mutable lock state |
| `intake_definition_ref` | profile author explicitly selects intake | exact ref or explicit `null`; no implicit inheritance | definition's exact `artifact_kind_ref` equals selected kind; capability-required constitutional coverage cannot be disabled | kind does not list/fingerprint intakes; no prompt-owned behavior |
| `renderer_definition_refs` | profile author explicitly selects fixed renderers | explicit list, possibly empty | subset of compatible kind refs | not Projection selection |
| `projection_definition_refs` | profile author selects compatible catalog definitions for this instance | explicit list, possibly empty | subset of kind-compatible definitions; exact refs/fingerprints; profile catalog contains each selection | selection does not create a Phase-2 view or executable hook |
| `validation_overlay_refs` | profile author selects declarative repository constraints | empty | exact schema/declarative refs; only equal/stricter rules | no executable hook or weakened floor |
| `extensions` | descriptor schema owns namespaced optional additions | empty | declared namespace/schema | no unknown required behavior |

The constitutional-root instance adds these gates: it is the only instance whose `capability_refs` contains `constitutional_root`, its requiredness is `always`, its kind capability bindings satisfy the versioned constitutional contract, and no overlay, condition, role/vocabulary mapping, or adapter can remove or weaken that authority. Its `role_ref` remains a separate registered role, normally `constitutional_authority`.

Dependency conformance scenarios required by implementation packets include: zero/one/two providers against both cardinalities; an exact contract-version match and mismatch; duplicate same-capability declarations in one kind; deterministic ordering of multiple `at_least_one` providers; and refusal when an instance dependency uses any cardinality other than `exactly_one`.

The exact illustrative Charter intake is coverage-complete for the frozen constitutional capability and retained Charter domains:

| Required constitutional binding | Required coverage ID |
|---|---|
| `policy_root`, `policy_revision` | `policy.authority_and_revision` |
| `decision_authority` | `governance.decision_authority` |
| `required_approvals` | `governance.required_approvals` |
| `exception_policy` | `governance.exception_policy` |
| `engineering_posture_dimensions` | `engineering_posture.dimensions` |
| `red_lines` | `engineering_posture.red_lines` |
| `review_triggers` | `governance.review_triggers` |
| `reassessment_triggers` | `governance.reassessment_triggers` |

| Retained Charter domain | Required coverage ID |
|---|---|
| project shape | `project_shape.definition` |
| delivery constraints | `delivery.constraints` |
| default delivery implications (backward compatibility, migration planning, rollout controls, deprecation policy, observability threshold) | `delivery.default_implications` |
| operational reality | `operational_reality.production_state` |
| risk domains | `risk.domains` |
| posture and engineering dimensions | `engineering_posture.dimensions`, `engineering_posture.red_lines` |
| exceptions and governance | `governance.decision_authority`, `governance.required_approvals`, `governance.exception_policy`, `governance.review_triggers`, `governance.reassessment_triggers` |
| debt | `debt.register` |
| decision records | `decisions.records` |

Meta-validation requires every constitutional binding and every retained domain in these matrices to resolve at least one required coverage item whose target path equals or is an ancestor of the bound schema pointer. Every populated candidate field is source-mapped. Missing, optionalized, unmapped, or conflicting coverage refuses initial promotion.

Intake gates:

- every v1 coverage item maps to one or more valid candidate-schema paths;
- constitutional intake meta-validation proves complete required-binding and retained-domain coverage before the definition fingerprint is admitted;
- shorter modes cannot weaken required coverage or hide unknowns;
- inferable observations record evidence, confidence, freshness, and sensitivity;
- normative/constitutional decisions identify the authority required to approve them;
- question wording may vary by skill/projection, but stable coverage IDs and evaluation semantics do not;
- no intake definition embeds a model/provider call.

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_id`, `schema_version` | Handbook record-schema registry identifies definition shape | none | exact supported pair | not intake semantic identity |
| `intake_id`, `intake_version` | intake author owns coverage-contract identity | none | stable ID plus SemVer; unique tuple | no prompt/version inference |
| `artifact_kind_ref` | intake author selects target kind | none | exact kind ref | no cross-kind candidate mutation |
| `candidate_schema_ref` | intake author selects candidate structural shape | none | exact schema ref matching the kind's canonical schema unless a reviewed normalization contract says otherwise | no weaker mode-specific schema |
| `supported_modes` | intake author permits acquisition paths | none; at least one | subset of `guided_adaptive`, `express`, `agent_assisted`; unique | mode does not change quality bar |
| `coverage` | intake author owns stable coverage semantics | none; at least one for rich intake | unique IDs; deterministic dependency/applicability graph | not terminal question order |
| `coverage[].coverage_id` | intake author owns semantic coverage identity | none | stable unique ID | wording is not identity |
| `coverage[].target_paths` | intake author maps coverage to candidate fields | none; non-empty in v1 | unique valid JSON Pointers in candidate schema | rationale-only/evidence-only non-field coverage awaits a later typed disposition contract; no implicit free-text placement |
| `coverage[].applicability` | intake author owns deterministic applicability | none | `always` or exact declarative condition ref | no script/model judgment |
| `coverage[].authority_class` | Handbook authority taxonomy classifies the value | none | `observational`, `rationale`, or `normative` | evidence does not become normative authority |
| `coverage[].acquisition.inferable` | intake author allows evidence-backed inference | `false` | boolean consistent with authority class | normative policy is not silently inferable |
| `coverage[].acquisition.user_declaration_required` | intake author marks declaration authority | `false` only when omission is explicit | boolean; normative constitutional fields require it unless the approval policy supplies stronger authority | no mode-specific bypass |
| `coverage[].acquisition.evidence_kinds` | intake author allows evidence classes | empty | registered evidence kinds | no embedded validator execution |
| `coverage[].acquisition.freshness` | intake author sets evidence freshness | `null` means no time-based claim, not indefinitely fresh | registered freshness rule | no wall-clock-only authority |
| `coverage[].acquisition.sensitivity` | intake author sets handling class | `internal` | registered sensitivity class and redaction policy | no unrestricted secret capture |
| `coverage[].acquisition.deterministic_default` | intake author may declare a non-inferred default with authority effect | `null` | value validates; source is recorded; forbidden where declaration/approval is required | no silent constitutional default |
| `coverage[].evaluation.required` | intake author sets promotion coverage requirement | `false` | boolean; shorter modes cannot change it | not artifact-instance requiredness |
| `coverage[].evaluation.minimum_specificity` | intake author sets deterministic quality floor | none when required | registered evaluator | no subjective prompt-only judgment |
| `coverage[].evaluation.minimum_confidence` | intake author sets the evidence/declaration confidence floor | none when required | registered ordered confidence value; source kind may impose a higher floor | no agent confidence as authority by itself |
| `coverage[].evaluation.unknown_policy` | intake author sets `block`, `allow_explicit`, or `require_waiver` | `block` for required coverage; otherwise omission is invalid | allowlisted value compatible with authority class and approval policy | no hidden unknown |
| `coverage[].evaluation.contradiction_policy` | intake author sets `block`, `require_resolution`, or `record_warning` | `block` for required normative coverage; otherwise omission is invalid | allowlisted value compatible with authority class | no silent last-write-wins |
| `coverage[].evaluation.waiver_policy_ref` | intake author selects waiver authority when waivers are permitted | `null` means not waivable | exact compatible policy ref | waiver does not equal satisfied truth |
| `coverage[].prompt_guidance_refs` | skill/presentation contract owns optional wording guidance | empty | safe exact refs; guidance cannot change coverage/evaluation | no prompt text as semantic identity |
| `approval_policy_ref` | intake author selects promotion authority policy | exact ref or `null` for non-governed kinds | compatible with kind/capabilities; constitutional intake requires non-null | no agent self-approval |
| `reassessment_triggers[].trigger_ref` | intake author declares a targeted reopen condition | empty trigger list; no per-entry default | exact versioned trigger definition with fingerprint producer; unique | no implicit whole-artifact reassessment |
| `reassessment_triggers[].affected_coverage_ids` | intake author owns the exact coverage subset reopened by the trigger | none per entry; non-empty | every ID exists in this definition; unique and deterministically ordered | an unrelated coverage item does not reopen |
| `extensions` | intake schema owns namespaced optional additions | empty | declared namespace/schema | no unknown required behavior |
| `intake_definition_fingerprint` | Handbook derives exact intake-definition identity | none | uniform exact-definition fingerprint including target kind/schema, approval policy, and trigger-definition fingerprints | no stable intake ref with mutable coverage/authority semantics |

Typed coverage results are `satisfied`, `unknown`, `contradicted`, `waived`, `not_applicable`, or `blocked`. `not_applicable` includes applicability evidence; `waived` includes exact waiver authority and expiry/review rules; neither is equivalent to `satisfied`. Required `unknown`, `contradicted`, or `blocked` coverage prevents promotion.

`source_kind` is exactly one of `user_declaration`, `evidenced_inference`, `deterministic_default`, `known_unknown`, `contradiction`, or `waiver`. Approval is a separate authority record, never a value source. Prompt events are descriptive audit references and do not become coverage identity or canonical truth.

| `promotion_fingerprint` | Handbook derives immutable transition identity | none | deterministic normalized record | no wall-clock identity |

Promotion re-resolves the exact profile, kind, schema, intake, capability, renderer, lifecycle, and approval-policy refs; compares the candidate and current target fingerprints; reruns every current validation layer; writes canonical YAML atomically; then emits the immutable promotion record. Any drift, missing approval, unresolved required coverage, unknown required semantic, or failed write leaves canonical truth unchanged and returns a typed refusal.

Record finalization and lineage are strictly append-only:

1. finalize and fingerprint `ArtifactIntakeRecord` after coverage evaluation;
2. build/finalize `ArtifactCandidate` with `intake_record_ref`;
3. write one or more immutable approval records with candidate ref/fingerprint;
4. write promotion only after validating the candidate and required approvals;
5. derive any forward index from downstream refs without rewriting prior records.

Required conformance scenarios include: an empty `target_paths` item refuses in v1; one trigger reopens only its non-empty mapped coverage set; unknown/unmapped triggers refuse; creating a candidate/approval/promotion leaves prior record bytes and fingerprints unchanged; reordered or stale lineage refuses; rejected/wrong-authority approval cannot promote; changing a parent/repository profile layer while retaining the selected `profile_ref` invalidates the old `resolved_profile_fingerprint`; and current candidate/target/fully-resolved-profile/definition fingerprints are required at compare-and-write.

## Charter intake and canonical contract

`CharterIntakeDefinition` is the first rich first-party intake definition. Its coverage must account for the historical domains of project shape, delivery constraints, operational reality, posture and delivery implications, risk domains, engineering dimensions, exceptions/governance, debt, and decision records. Research/design may revise questions and branches, but omissions are explicit decisions. This contract does not decide the shipped default kind/instance set reserved for HCM-0.6.

Guided-adaptive, express, and agent-assisted modes all produce the same canonical Charter candidate schema. The skill-directed LLM agent conducts the conversation and invokes Handbook CLI/SDK operations; Handbook owns coverage/evaluation/promotion and performs no hidden nested synthesis.

Canonical Charter YAML owns approved constitutional truth. Intake provenance explains how it was reached. Before Phase 3, Markdown and other fixed human-review outputs are renderer-derived views; Phase-3 Resolution-aware GUI, packet, and agent-context outputs are Projections. Neither output class is an independently editable authority.

The versioned `constitutional_root` capability contract requires schema bindings for:

- policy root and policy revision;
- decision authority and required approval classes;
- exception/waiver authority and record requirements;
- effective engineering-posture dimensions, floors, and red lines;
- review and targeted reassessment triggers.

Exactly one resolved artifact instance selects this capability and is `always` required. A custom kind may expose the capability only when its exact capability contract, bindings, semantic validators, intake/approval posture, and lifecycle policy pass. A role ref, label, filename, current enum variant, or requiredness flag alone never grants constitutional authority.

Charter-specific defaults are intentionally narrow: absent optional rationale/evidence collections are empty only when the Charter content schema allows it; policy, authority, posture floors/red lines, required approvals, and required coverage have no implicit default. The HCM-0.6 decision may choose a shipped binding/path/label but cannot weaken these semantics.

Explicit non-goals are a rigid CLI questionnaire, prompt-owned policy, agent self-approval, Markdown authority, a second editable posture document, automatic whole-Charter regeneration on one changed condition, or default-set selection by example.

## Artifact validation layers

Do not ask one schema mechanism to own every kind of correctness:

1. **Structural schema** — fields, types, enumerations, requiredness, and local shape after YAML parsing.
2. **Semantic validation** — cross-field, cross-artifact, lifecycle, capability, and authority invariants owned by Handbook.
3. **Intake coverage evaluation** — whether required information was established with appropriate evidence, specificity, confidence, and approval.
4. **External validator docks** — domain-specific witnesses that emit normalized evidence without becoming artifact or contract authority.

A custom kind may need only structural and semantic validation. Human-authored constitutional/governance kinds commonly add intake coverage. Docks remain optional unless the kind/profile/contract requires them.

In Phase 2, a fixed deterministic first-party renderer may produce a renderer-derived human-review view only from validated canonical truth. That view accepts no Context Resolution envelope and is outside the capitalized Phase-3 `Projection` request/result/provenance contract.

Validation order is structural schema -> Handbook semantic/capability validation -> intake coverage/approval when applicable -> required external evidence gates when a later contract demands them. Passing a later layer cannot waive an earlier failure. Unknown required semantics fail closed; warnings never promote blocked truth.

## Vocabulary contract

The vocabulary schema distinguishes labels, aliases, and structural absorption:

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.vocabulary-profile
schema_version: "1.0"
vocabulary_id: handbook.vocabulary.example
vocabulary_version: "1.0.0"
stable_role_registry:
  ref: handbook.roles.core@1.0.0
  fingerprint: sha256:...
labels:
  coordination_horizon: phase
  delivery_unit: feature
  implementation_unit: slice
  execution_envelope: packet
  atomic_action: task
aliases:
  implementation_unit:
    - task
absorptions:
  - unit_id: implementation
    absorbs:
      - implementation_unit
      - execution_envelope
      - atomic_action
extensions: {}
vocabulary_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

Duplicate displayed labels are legal. Ambiguity matters only when a machine operation cannot resolve a stable role from the surrounding typed context.

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_id`, `schema_version` | Handbook record-schema registry identifies vocabulary record shape | none | exact supported pair | not vocabulary semantic identity |
| `vocabulary_id`, `vocabulary_version` | vocabulary author owns one versioned mapping | none | stable ID plus SemVer; unique tuple | no implicit local vocabulary |
| `stable_role_registry.ref`/fingerprint | stable-role registry owns keys/default labels/categories; vocabulary author pins it | none | exact pair matches resolved profile and consuming kinds | no ambient registry or mutable fallback label |
| `labels` | vocabulary author owns display labels for registered stable roles | missing role uses the stable-role registry's canonical display label | keys are registered roles; values non-empty; duplicate values allowed | no change to stable role meaning or machine IDs |
| `aliases` | vocabulary author owns accepted display/search aliases | empty map/list | keys registered; aliases normalized; ambiguity surfaced in untyped input | aliases do not select typed operations by themselves |
| `absorptions[].unit_id` | vocabulary author names one local workflow unit | none | stable local ID; unique | not a new Handbook stable role |
| `absorptions[].absorbs` | vocabulary author explicitly combines registered workflow roles for presentation/execution mapping | empty absorptions | registered roles; directed acyclic mapping; one owning absorption per role; adapter preservation checked | cannot absorb constitutional authority, erase approval/evidence boundaries, or change schemas/commands |
| `extensions` | vocabulary schema owns namespaced optional additions | empty | declared namespace/schema | no unknown required behavior |
| `vocabulary_fingerprint` | Handbook derives exact vocabulary identity | none | normalized SHA-256 over all semantic fields plus stable-role registry fingerprint except this field | no unchanged fingerprint after registry/label/absorption drift |

Stable role resolution always uses typed context first. Untyped ambiguous input returns candidates or a typed refusal. Profile vocabulary never renames schema IDs, profile/kind/instance IDs, capability IDs, SDK/JSON operation IDs, or CLI commands. An adapter that cannot preserve structural absorption reports typed loss/refusal rather than silently flattening it.

This is a complete internally consistent conformance example, not a shipped stack decision. HCM-0.3 freezes the contract and comparison semantics without selecting product labels or a shipped stack.

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| schema identity | Handbook schema registry | none | exact supported pair | not stack semantic version |
| `stack_id`, `stack_version` | stack author owns semantic identity | none | stable ID plus SemVer; unique tuple; exact ref derived from both | no implicit `default`/latest stack |
| `levels` | stack author owns the named linear stack and defaults | none; at least one | unique stable IDs in declared broad-to-narrow order; each has all six valid defaults | no arbitrary graph or L0-L3 inference |
| `dimension_domains` | stack author owns profile-specific value IDs and total order | none; exactly six non-empty domains | every domain has contiguous unique ranks from zero; rank zero grants least reach/disclosure/durability/claim authority | no seventh aggregate score or reversed per-profile privilege meaning |
| level `defaults` | stack author selects one value from each domain | none | exactly six values; every value belongs to its domain; a narrower level cannot default to a higher rank than its predecessor | defaults do not override an envelope's explicit complete dimensions |
| policy/matcher refs | named Handbook definitions own comparison, selector, escalation, and promotion semantics | none | exact refs/fingerprints; compatible versions; no executable/remote hook | no invocation-selected policy |
| `extensions` | definition schema owns namespaced optional additions | empty | declared optional namespaces | no unknown required semantics |
| `definition_fingerprint` | Handbook derives exact stack identity | none | RFC 8785/SHA-256 over normalized record and exact referenced-definition fingerprints except itself | no timestamp, path, or display-only drift hidden behind an unchanged fingerprint |

```

An envelope is fully materialized; omission never means “inherit later.” A child cites at most one exact parent envelope and repeats the complete effective state. Independent constraints are exact ref/fingerprint inputs rather than merge parents.

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| schema identity and `envelope_id` | Handbook schema registry identifies shape; creating authority identifies this immutable envelope | none | exact schema; stable unique ID | not a mutable session setting |
| `resolved_profile` | selected profile remains semantic authority | none | exact ref/fingerprint; profile selects the cited stack/catalog | no invocation-time profile mutation |
| `resolution_stack` | selected stack definition owns level/domain comparison | none | exact ref/fingerprint equals resolved profile selection | no ambient or CLI-owned stack |
| `active_level_id` | envelope creator selects a named default position | none | exists in stack | not an aggregate authority score |
| `objective_ref` | parent work/operation authority identifies purpose | none | stable typed ref resolvable within scope | does not grant mutation authority |
| `dimensions` | envelope creator selects complete operating bounds under stack semantics | none; all six required | each value resolves; every child rank is less than or equal to parent rank | no token-budget proxy or omitted inherited dimension |
| `parent_envelope` | parent execution/view authority constrains child | root: `null`; child: exact ref/fingerprint | at most one; acyclic; same exact profile/stack; cited fingerprint matches | no multi-parent merge |
| `constraint_inputs` | named contracts/artifacts own applicable constraints | empty | exact typed ref/fingerprint pairs; deterministic stable ordering | no prose-only or bare mutable ref |
| `mutation_rules` | parent/creating authority grants or denies typed targets | explicit list, possibly empty | known target kinds; selectors validate through exact matcher; child allow set is a subset of parent; deny is union and wins | no unknown resource namespace, absolute-path escape, or child relaxation |
| `escalation_triggers` | exact trigger definitions own detection semantics | explicit list | unique IDs; exact refs/fingerprints; missing-context/authority condition is reportable | trigger detection does not approve escalation |
| `envelope_fingerprint` | Handbook derives immutable resolved identity | none | normalized complete record plus exact profile/stack/parent/constraint/policy fingerprints except itself | no caller-supplied or timestamp-based identity |

Envelope conformance scenarios:

| Scenario | Required result |
|---|---|
| identical complete inputs resolve twice | identical envelope fingerprint |
| child narrows any subset of dimensions and mutation allows | passes and preserves every parent deny |
| child increases one dimension rank or adds a mutation target | refuses and emits an escalation candidate; no partial widening |
| parent fingerprint is stale or profile/stack differs | refuses |
| allow and deny both match | deny wins and the effective set is unambiguous |
| validation claim exceeds `validation_horizon` | claim remains `not_authorized`, never passed |
| memory write exceeds `memory_horizon` | requires a separately authorized `ResolutionPromotionRequest` and terminal applied disposition |

Requests and dispositions are separate append-only records. A request is pending only while no terminal disposition exists; it never changes status in place. The escalation registry admits exactly one terminal disposition per exact request: `approved`, `refused`, or `superseded`. `approved` requires the exact decision and authorized replacement envelope; `refused` requires the decision and null authorized/superseding fields; `superseded` requires the decision and one exact distinct superseding-request pair. The promotion registry likewise admits exactly one `applied`, `refused`, or `stale` disposition per exact request. `applied` requires target-horizon validation, an authorized approver, compare-and-write against the request's `expected_target_fingerprint`, and one exact new semantic-memory result pair; refused/stale dispositions have a null result. Duplicate dispositions, in-place request mutation, reuse of an ID for changed bytes, and a disposition whose request fingerprint is stale all fail closed. Snapshots, deltas, and Projections remain immutable evidence and never become canonical artifacts/contracts merely because they are promotion inputs.

| Field family | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| request/disposition IDs and schema identity | Handbook schema registry/creating orchestrator | none | exact schemas; every record has a stable unique ID and fingerprint | no lifecycle mutation behind a reused ID |
| current/proposed envelope pairs | exact envelope records own bounds | none | refs/fingerprints match; proposal uses same profile/stack and changes at least one bound | no in-place envelope mutation |
| trigger/missing condition/requested authority | escalation policy and parent authority own why/who | none | exact trigger pair; typed missing condition; authority resolves above current bound | no “need more context” without a concrete condition |
| escalation disposition | requested authority owns terminal decision | absent while pending; exactly one terminal record | exact request/decision pair; outcome-specific authorized envelope or superseding request; registry uniqueness | request cannot self-approve or mutate into a disposition |
| promotion source inputs/envelope | immutable source records and envelope own observed boundary | none; non-empty sources | exact pairs; source envelope admits observation | no source promotion into canonical authority |
| target horizon/record/expected fingerprint | target semantic-memory authority owns write location | expected fingerprint `null` only for create | target rank exceeds source only through approved policy; compare-and-write basis exact | no artifact/contract/posture mutation shortcut |
| promotion disposition | target validation and authority own terminal admission | absent while pending; result null unless applied | exact request/decision; applied has complete paired evidence, authorized approver, successful compare-and-write, exact new result; stale/refused has no result | no unreviewed semantic-memory write or in-place outcome change |
| request/disposition fingerprints | Handbook derives immutable transition identity | none | normalized complete record except its own fingerprint; exact request pair enters disposition fingerprint | no mutable transition history |

Transition conformance requires request-only pending state, one valid terminal disposition, byte-identical replay of every prior request/disposition, and refusal of a second terminal disposition. Tests cover escalation approval/refusal/supersession and promotion application/refusal/stale compare-and-write without changing prior bytes.

```

Every `ProjectionDefinition` binds one exact disclosure-policy ref/fingerprint. Each field rule binds one classification registered by the policy's exact classification registry and a complete six-dimension `minimum_resolution`. An unregistered definition classification invalidates the definition and refuses before any result/evaluation record or payload read; it never reaches policy fallback. Before protected payload bytes are read, the engine compares every request-envelope dimension rank with the rule minimum under the exact envelope stack: any lower rank yields `out_of_resolution`. It then evaluates the policy only over stable source metadata `(source_kind, exact source ref, source_pointer, disclosure_classification)`. A registered tuple matching no policy rule uses `unmatched_action: redact`; matching `redact` wins over matching `allow`; matcher indeterminacy, missing/stale policy, stale classification registry, or incompatible matcher refuses the request with no payload read. Invocation cannot replace or weaken the policy.

An immutable source may already carry an exact upstream redaction-disposition pair. Coverage uses the disposition's `original_pointer` and JSON Pointer segment boundaries. A request for that original pointer or its descendants maps any upstream `omit`, `fingerprint_only`, `artifact_ref_only`, or `redacted_summary` action to a Projection `redacted` omission before generic policy evaluation; it never maps to `unavailable`, and the engine never rereads the hidden original. The disposition's optional typed `retained.pointer` is outside the original subtree and is never covered merely because it shares earlier path segments; a request for that exact retained field evaluates it independently through its own rule/classification. Only an allowed pointer with no covering upstream disposition that cannot be read becomes `unavailable`. Runtime source-kind/schema/pointer or derivation-I/O rejection becomes `unsupported` before value access.

Every definition also binds one exact built-in `support_evaluator` ref/fingerprint. That pure metadata-only contract owns source-kind/schema compatibility, source-pointer existence/type, target-pointer/schema compatibility, and derivation input/output compatibility. Semantic-capability compatibility is not an evaluator input or `unsupported` reason: exact profile/definition/source validation resolves every selected capability contract and binding before per-rule evaluation, and invalid capability semantics refuse with no result. A valid evaluator can return `supported` or the typed per-rule `unsupported` outcome without reading value bytes. Missing, stale, unresolved, or schema-incompatible evaluator identity refuses before result construction. Changing only evaluator identity or semantics changes its fingerprint, the enclosing definition fingerprint, every applicable disclosure-evaluation fingerprint, and the result fingerprint.

Deterministic per-applicable-rule order is: validate exact definition/profile/source identity, support-evaluator identity, and mandatory currentness -> compare `minimum_resolution` -> map upstream redaction disposition -> evaluate exact disclosure policy -> evaluate runtime source-path/schema support through the bound evaluator -> read allowed bytes -> include/derive or record `unavailable`. Operation mismatch is classified before this disclosure sequence as the sole `not_applicable` case. A protected-source spy must observe zero value reads for `out_of_resolution`, `redacted`, policy/support refusal, or `unsupported` outcomes.

| Field family | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| policy actions/defaults | policy author owns allow/redact decision | v1 fixes a registered unmatched tuple to `redact`, indeterminate to `refuse`, and overlap to `redact_wins` | known actions; definition classifications registered before evaluation; complete deterministic precedence; no payload-dependent matcher input | no fallback for an unregistered definition classification, permissive unmatched default, or caller override |
| policy rules | policy author maps stable metadata tuples to allow/redact | none; non-empty | registered classifications/source kinds; deterministic pointer selectors; stable IDs; overlap replay | no prompt/model/transport rule or content inspection |
| field-rule `minimum_resolution` | Projection-definition author owns the least envelope that may disclose the rule | none; all six dimensions | every value belongs to the exact request-envelope stack domain; complete rank comparison | no named-level shortcut or aggregate score |
| field-rule `disclosure_classification` | classification registry and definition author own sensitivity class | none | exact registered class evaluated by bound policy | no filename/label inference or value sniffing |
| upstream redaction mapping | immutable source disposition owns prior hiding; Projection engine maps it | absent when no upstream disposition covers the pointer | exact disposition/source/pointer coverage; every non-raw upstream action maps original pointer to `redacted`; no reread | no downgrade to `unavailable`, recovery of omitted bytes, or policy weakening |
| `policy_fingerprint` | Handbook derives disclosure closure | none | normalized complete policy plus exact registry/matcher fingerprints except itself | no unchanged fingerprint after rule/default drift |

The exact ref is `support_evaluator_id + "@" + support_evaluator_version`. The evaluator receives only the listed normalized metadata fields, resolved from the exact already-validated selected source metadata, field rule, target schema, and derivation pair; it never receives source-definition or semantic-capability identity and never receives payload values. Exact profile/definition/source validation has already resolved every source-definition identity plus semantic-capability contract and binding for every admitted source kind; a missing, stale, unregistered, or incompatible definition/capability pair refuses before this evaluator and produces neither `unsupported` nor a result. The evaluator first validates its own exact schema-registry/pointer/derivation-contract pairs. Missing, stale, unresolved, or incompatible evaluator/registry/contract state refuses before result construction. Otherwise it evaluates `unsupported_reason_precedence` in order. The first matching reason returns `support_status: unsupported` plus that exact `support_reason`; if none matches, it returns `support_status: supported` with `support_reason: null`. A prior disclosure short-circuit records `support_status: not_evaluated` and `support_reason: null` without invoking the evaluator.

`evaluator_fingerprint` is RFC 8785/SHA-256 over the normalized complete definition plus exact schema-registry, pointer-semantics, and derivation-compatibility fingerprints except itself. Changing the input list, supported source kinds, reason order, or any exact dependency therefore changes the evaluator pair. Extensions follow the shared HCM-0.3 optional-only rule and enter the evaluator fingerprint; they cannot add required support behavior or reorder base reasons.

Source kinds are `artifact_kind`, `artifact_instance`, `semantic_capability`, `snapshot`, `snapshot_delta`, or another registered semantic record class. Canonical artifacts and immutable semantic/observation records are both valid typed sources, but Projection preserves the source's existing authority class; accepting a snapshot or delta never labels it canonical truth or peer authority. V1 selector cardinality is always `exactly_one`; zero or multiple identity matches refuse rather than choosing by source order. A rule may reveal one compatible source path or derive through one exact allowlisted Handbook derivation. Rule graphs are acyclic; every target pointer has one producer; required rules cannot be silently dropped. Definitions contain no executable hook, remote code, command, prompt, or transport renderer.

| `required_for_result`/`claim_refs` | contract/definition author declares decision-completeness and claim-observation consequences | `false`/empty | claims resolve and source path can observe them; exact inclusion/omission truth table below; every potentially omitted target pointer is structurally omittable in the target schema | `required_for_result` does not suppress the Projection result, make the target pointer unconditionally schema-required, or create automatic passing evidence |

## Projection request

This capitalized `Projection` request/result pair belongs only to the Phase 3 generic Resolution-aware Projection engine. A Phase 2 fixed deterministic first-party renderer produces a renderer-derived human-review view, not a Projection; it accepts no Resolution envelope and is excluded from this request/result/provenance contract. Generic configured custom-kind Projections and every Resolution-aware view are deferred until the `HCM-3.2` Context Resolution kernel and `HCM-3.3` deterministic Projection engine land.

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.projection-request
schema_version: "1.0"
request_id: projection-request.example
sources:
  - selector_id: project_context
    ref: artifact.project-context@7
    fingerprint: sha256:...
resolved_profile: { ref: handbook.profile.example@1.0.0, fingerprint: sha256:... }
vocabulary: { ref: handbook.vocabulary.example@1.0.0, fingerprint: sha256:... }
projection_definition: { ref: handbook.projection.example-agent-packet@1.0.0, fingerprint: sha256:... }
resolution_envelope: { ref: envelope.example.execution, fingerprint: sha256:... }
operation: reveal
surface: agent_packet
purpose: delegated_execution_context
currentness:
  mode: none
  revision_basis: null
  expected_family_revisions: []
```

The request must use the exact profile-selected vocabulary, stack, catalog, and complete envelope; every source selector binds exactly one stable source identity through its ref/fingerprint pair. Zero/multiple identity matches, an invalid pair, stale definition/profile/capability semantics, or a failed mandatory currentness precondition refuses. Operation and surface must be allowed by the definition. For a valid exactly bound source, envelope access is evaluated per applicable field rule before protected payload bytes are read: envelope denial produces `out_of_resolution`, redaction produces `redacted`, payload unavailability produces `unavailable`, and a runtime-unsupported source kind/path/schema or derivation I/O produces `unsupported`. Each is a typed omission with its proof effect, never a request refusal or `not_applicable`; hidden content is not loaded and then concealed. Invocation cannot replace profile, vocabulary, definition, or envelope semantics.

## Projection result

This result is Phase-3-only and is never required for a fixed pre-Phase-3 renderer-derived view.

Allowed `operation` values initially:

- `reveal`;
- `derive`.

Reserve `synthesize_candidate` in the conceptual model but do not implement it in the first projection slice.

Omission entries contain `rule_id`, source selector/path, the rule's exact claim refs, one of `out_of_resolution`, `redacted`, `unavailable`, or `unsupported`, and exactly one `proof_effect`: `not_observed` or `none`. `required_for_result` means required for a complete decision/evidence-bearing view, not required for the existence of the Projection result record. An omitted target pointer is absent from `output`; every Projection target schema must allow that typed absence for every potentially omitted rule, or the definition is invalid before execution. A result with an omitted required rule is still emitted and schema-valid but is incomplete for any positive decision/proof use and carries `not_observed`. In v1, each field rule's declared `operation` is its complete applicability condition. A rule whose operation differs from the request appears exactly once in `not_applicable` with `reason: operation_mismatch`; it is not an omission and has no proof effect. The definition rule IDs must equal the disjoint union of `included`, `omissions`, and `not_applicable` rule IDs.

`disclosure_evaluations` contains exactly one entry for every applicable rule, sorted by the rule's one-based `definition_rule_ordinal`, and none for operation-mismatch rules. No ordinal may be duplicated, skipped among applicable rules, or reordered. Each entry contains `rule_id`, `definition_rule_ordinal`, `minimum_resolution_outcome`, `upstream_redaction_check`, `upstream_redaction_disposition`, `policy_evaluation`, ordered `matched_policy_rule_ids`, resolved `policy_action`, exact `support_evaluator` ref/fingerprint, `support_status`, `support_reason`, `payload_access`, `final_disposition`, and `evaluation_fingerprint`. The support pair is always present and equals the definition pair even when a prior short-circuit makes `support_status: not_evaluated`; `support_reason` is non-null exactly for `unsupported` and is the evaluator's first matching frozen reason. Policy/definition/support/currentness refusal occurs before result construction and therefore emits no result or disclosure-evaluation record.

`evaluation_fingerprint` is RFC 8785/SHA-256 over the normalized evaluation entry except itself plus the exact result-level source pair selected by the rule, Projection-definition pair/fingerprint (which closes over the disclosure policy and rule), and envelope pair/fingerprint. A non-null upstream-disposition pair is already inside the entry. The enclosing `result_fingerprint` hashes the complete ordered evaluation list. Derivation entries bind rule/derivation refs, exact input fingerprints, output fingerprint, and `lossy: true|false` declared by the derivation definition.

Exact inclusion/omission/proof table:

| Rule applicability/outcome | `required_for_result` | `claim_refs` | Target/output treatment | `proof_effect` and result treatment |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| operation mismatch | either | either | target absent; one `not_applicable(operation_mismatch)` entry | no `proof_effect`; requiredness is irrelevant because the rule is not applicable |
| applicable and included | either | either | target present and schema-valid | no `proof_effect`; included claims may be evaluated only from the cited source/output |
| applicable and omitted | `true` | empty or non-empty | target absent through schema-declared typed omission | `not_observed`; result is emitted but incomplete/non-passing for decision or proof use |
| applicable and omitted | `false` | non-empty | target absent through schema-declared typed omission | `not_observed` for every named claim; result is emitted and no named claim is satisfied |
| applicable and omitted | `false` | empty | target absent through schema-declared typed omission | `none`; result is emitted with lossiness determined by the omission reason |

Exact disclosure-evaluation outcome matrix (`upstream disposition` is always an exact `{ref, fingerprint}` pair when non-null, and every row carries the same exact definition-bound `support_evaluator` pair):

| Final disposition | `minimum_resolution_outcome` | `upstream_redaction_check` / disposition | `policy_evaluation` / matched IDs / action | `support_status` / reason | `payload_access` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `out_of_resolution` | `insufficient` | `not_evaluated` / `null` | `not_evaluated` / `[]` / `not_evaluated` | `not_evaluated` / `null` | `not_attempted` |
| `redacted` by upstream disposition | `sufficient` | `covered` / exact pair | `not_evaluated` / `[]` / `not_evaluated` | `not_evaluated` / `null` | `not_attempted` |
| `redacted` by matched policy rule(s) | `sufficient` | `none` / `null` | `matched` / non-empty definition order / `redact` | `not_evaluated` / `null` | `not_attempted` |
| `redacted` by registered unmatched tuple | `sufficient` | `none` / `null` | `unmatched_default` / `[]` / `redact` | `not_evaluated` / `null` | `not_attempted` |
| `unsupported` | `sufficient` | `none` / `null` | `matched` / non-empty definition order / `allow` | `unsupported` / exact first reason | `not_attempted` |
| `unavailable` | `sufficient` | `none` / `null` | `matched` / non-empty definition order / `allow` | `supported` / `null` | `attempted_unavailable` |
| `included` | `sufficient` | `none` / `null` | `matched` / non-empty definition order / `allow` | `supported` / `null` | `read` |

For overlapping matched rules, `matched_policy_rule_ids` retains exact policy-definition order and the resolved action is `redact` if any match redacts. A policy refusal (`indeterminate` matcher, missing/stale/incompatible policy or registry), invalid/unregistered definition classification, invalid source identity/cardinality, or failed mandatory currentness check emits no Projection result. Mixed-rule fixtures must reproduce byte-identical evaluation ordering, evaluation fingerprints, and the enclosing result fingerprint.

Lossiness uses this fixed precedence:

| Highest matching condition | Result lossiness |
|---|---|
| any omission is `redacted` | `redacted` |
| otherwise any omission is `unavailable` or `unsupported` | `partial` |
| otherwise any omission is `out_of_resolution`, or any included derivation is lossy | `collapsed` |
| otherwise every applicable rule is included and every derivation is non-lossy | `lossless` |

Mixed reasons always take the highest row, so the caller cannot choose a friendlier label. `not_applicable` entries do not affect lossiness. Every generic request/result carries currentness basis/evidence: definition mode `none` requires null basis plus request `none`/empty expected revisions and result `none`/empty checks. `exact_revision_check` is valid only for definitions whose required families bind snapshot source selectors and fixes `revision_basis: captured_revision`. Each request expected family revision must equal that selected snapshot's family `captured_revision`, and each expected slot revision must equal its corresponding captured slot revision. Result observations must equal those same request/bound-snapshot values; pre/post revisions and arbitrary caller-supplied live values cannot substitute. Exact mode also requires definition/request/result tuple equality. The result fingerprint covers request/provenance, currentness validation, complete disclosure evaluations, included/omitted/not-applicable/derived entries, output fingerprint, lossiness, and authority effect except itself.

Projection conformance scenarios:

| Scenario | Required result |
|---|---|
| same exact request and source bytes execute twice | identical output and result fingerprints |
| a selector resolves zero or multiple sources | refuses; v1 never selects a source-order winner |
| an exactly bound applicable source field is outside the envelope | `out_of_resolution` omission with its proof effect; result remains completely accounted |
| an exactly bound applicable source field is redacted | `redacted` omission with its proof effect; protected bytes are not disclosed |
| an exactly bound applicable source payload is unavailable | `unavailable` omission with its proof effect; no request refusal unless a separate mandatory currentness check fails |
| an exactly bound applicable source kind/path/schema or derivation I/O is unsupported at runtime | `unsupported` omission with its proof effect |
| reveal request executes the example definition | `reveal_objective` is included and `derive_constraints` is exactly `not_applicable` because of operation mismatch |
| equivalent definitions reveal/derive from a canonical artifact, snapshot, or delta source | each result preserves the source's prior authority class and records `authority_effect: none`; observation sources do not become canonical/peer truth |
| each omission reason crosses required/non-required rules with empty/non-empty claims | output remains schema-valid with target absent; exact table selects `not_observed` or `none`; rule partition and lossiness remain complete; no false pass |
| definition/profile/vocabulary/envelope fingerprint is stale | refuses |
| request asks for unsupported operation/surface | refuses |
| expansion needs a higher dimension or mutation authority | returns a `ResolutionEscalationRequest` candidate; engine does not widen itself |
| definition contains a prompt, executable hook, remote ref, cycle, or two target producers | definition validation refuses |

Projection request/result field authority:

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| request/result schema and IDs | Handbook schema registry owns shape; caller/engine allocate immutable operation IDs | none | exact schema; unique stable IDs; result cites exact request | IDs do not grant authority |
| request `sources` | caller selects exact typed source identities allowed by definition; source records retain their prior authority class | none | paired ref/fingerprint and selector/cardinality satisfied; envelope/redaction/availability/support are evaluated per applicable rule into typed omissions | no parallel arrays, ambient discovery, request-wide envelope-visibility precondition, snapshot-to-canonical promotion, or hidden-payload read before access decision |
| profile/vocabulary/definition/envelope pairs | their exact definitions remain semantic/display/view/authority owners | none | exact matching fingerprints and cross-compatibility; request and result pairs identical | no invocation override or result-side substitution |
| request `operation`, `surface`, `purpose` | caller selects within definition | none | operation/surface allowed; purpose registered and non-authoritative | purpose does not change mapping rules |
| request `currentness` | exact definition owns mode/basis and family/selector/adapter/slot closure; bound snapshot owns expected values | none; field is always present | mode/basis equal definition; `none` is null/empty; exact tuples equal definition and values equal selected snapshot captured composite/slots | no extension/purpose-derived basis, caller-selected closure/value, or pre/post proxy |
| result `currentness_validation` | exact source adapters own observed live revisions; engine records evidence | none; field is always present | mode/basis equal definition/request; `none` is null/empty; exact tuples equal definition/request; observed equals request and bound captured values; all pass | no stale snapshot greened by unrelated equal live values, omitted evidence, or post-request source substitution |
| result `disclosure_evaluations` | exact stack, field rule, upstream source disposition, disclosure policy, and definition-bound support evaluator own decisions; engine records replay | none; one per applicable rule | exact applicable-rule set; exact support pair always equals definition; `unsupported` has first-precedence reason and other statuses have null reason; fixed evaluation order/nullability; final disposition equals included/omission entry; payload access consistent; evaluation fingerprint recomputes | no ambient support registry, unowned/free-form reason, evaluation for operation mismatch, hidden read, unrecorded policy default, or result-side reclassification |
| result `included` | engine records each executed reveal/derive rule | empty only when definition/request allow an empty result | unique rule IDs; exact source/target pointers/claims | no unproven claim implication |
| result `omissions` | engine records every applicable unexecuted rule | empty on fully included result | typed reason; exact rule/claim refs; target absent under an omission-compatible target schema; proof effect follows the complete requiredness/claim table; every applicable rule is included or omitted exactly once | no result suppression for a valid omission, silent omission, invented placeholder value, or green default |
| result `not_applicable` | engine records definition rules whose operation differs from the request | empty only when every rule uses the request operation | exact rule ID and `operation_mismatch`; disjoint-union accounting equals all definition rules | no omission reason, proof effect, or caller-defined condition |
| result `derivations` | exact derivation definition owns algorithm | empty for reveal-only result | exact derivation/input/output fingerprints and matching rule | no model/executable hook |
| result `output` | target schema owns shape; engine owns derived bytes | none | exact schema; content ref/fingerprint; output validates with omitted rule targets absent; a definition whose schema cannot represent any allowed typed omission is invalid | output is not canonical source authority and omission never inserts a fabricated placeholder |
| `lossiness` | engine derives from rule outcomes | none | exact computed enum consistent with omissions/derivations | caller cannot request `lossless` |
| `authority_effect` | architecture contract fixes view authority | always `none` | exact literal | no auto-promotion or source mutation |
| `result_fingerprint` | Handbook derives immutable result identity | none | normalized complete result plus exact provenance/output fingerprints except itself | no timestamp or mutable alias |

The versioned policy owns only static window semantics: stable window ID, source slot, count, cursor mode, and total ordering. At capture time each window binds that slot to one exact source ref/revision and supplies an opaque source-issued cursor or `null` for the rule-defined initial boundary. `exclusive` means the item named by a non-null cursor is not repeated. Reusing the same source revision, cursor, count, and ordering selects the same window. Source revision/cursor changes alter snapshot capture input and state/record fingerprints, not the policy definition fingerprint.

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| policy identity | capture-policy author owns selected-state semantics | none | stable ID plus SemVer; exact derived ref | no implicit local/default policy |
| `triggers` | policy author selects strategic capture boundaries | none; non-empty | registered trigger IDs; deterministic stable order; no command-by-command default | trigger does not change authority |
| `allowed_memory_horizons` | policy author limits where records produced by this policy may be stored | none; non-empty | unique valid horizons; capture envelope's memory horizon is a member; every horizon/trigger/record-class tuple is covered by retention | no invocation-selected durability |
| `state_families` | policy author selects exact source adapters and normalized fields | none; non-empty | registered family; exact adapter ref/fingerprint; adapter declares source/revision/payload schema | no ambient plugin or unrestricted payload |
| multi-source family slots/composite rule | family adapter definition owns source-slot identities; exact composite rule owns family revision | omitted only for single-slot families | unique declared slots; exact rule pair; composite covers every slot in stable order | no plan/ledger drift hidden behind one slot's revision |
| bounded-window definitions | policy author owns window ID/source slot/count/cursor mode/ordering | omitted when no window | unique window ID; positive bound; declared source slot; deterministic total order; exclusive cursor mode | no live revision/cursor in reusable policy and no nondeterministic “last N” |
| comparison/drift/predecessor refs | exact definitions own compatibility, signal, and predecessor-applicability rules | none | exact refs/fingerprints compatible with all families/triggers | no model interpretation, free-form causal classifier, or heuristic predecessor |
| redaction/retention refs | exact policies own disclosure/storage limits | none | exact refs/fingerprints; redaction fail-closed; retention honors referenced records/holds | no invocation override to expose denied content |
| `consistency` | policy author owns retries, bounded rule, and unstable disposition | none | bounded retries; declared skew rule; unstable action only `persist_non_promotable` or `refuse` | no unstable closeout/grounding claim |
| `policy_fingerprint` | Handbook derives policy closure | none | normalized policy plus every exact source/policy/rule fingerprint except itself | no timestamp or mutable source alias |

Changing any selected field, source adapter, source-slot/composite rule, memory horizon, static window rule, comparison/drift/predecessor rule, redaction/retention policy, or consistency behavior requires a changed policy version/fingerprint. Capture invocation selects an exact policy/trigger and supplies only exact live source revisions/cursors for declared slots/windows; it cannot widen the policy or memory horizon.

Every real family payload uses its source-adapter schema. The `work` family composite revision is derived by its exact rule over both declared source slots, and each window's `source_revision` equals the corresponding slot's captured revision. Work windows carry source revision, cursor, count, ordering, and selected stable IDs. Session state names the parent orchestration, applicable true-stop handoff, active internal dispatches, delegated-run reconciliation, and unresolved escalation refs. Evidence state contains refs/statuses rather than unrestricted command output.

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| schema identity and `snapshot_id` | Handbook schema registry identifies shape; capture service allocates immutable record identity | none | exact schema; unique stable ID | snapshot ID is not state identity |
| `capture` | exact capture policy owns observation semantics; engine derives top-level consistency | none | allowed trigger; matching policy fingerprint; monotonic start/end; bounded retry count; consistency equals aggregation table | caller cannot label the record more favorably |
| repository/workspace identity | capture source identifies observed workspace | none | stable normalized IDs | no absolute machine path in durable identity |
| boundary stream/sequence | capture service identifies transition stream and allocates record order | none | stable stream ref; sequence is unique and strictly increasing in repository/workspace/stream; allocation collision retries or refuses | no timestamp ordering, tie-breaker, or state-fingerprint input |
| profile/envelope pairs | selected semantic authority and execution/view boundary | none | exact refs/fingerprints; envelope cites profile and policy-compatible stack | snapshot does not alter either authority |
| `family_observations` | exact source adapter owns payload/revision schema | every policy-selected family required | exact adapter pair; pre/captured/post revisions; per-slot revisions and exact composite for multi-source families; policy-selected bound evaluation; family consistency; payload matches schema/fingerprint | no ambient or unversioned source or hidden source-slot drift |
| window capture inputs | capture invocation binds declared static window slots to live state | every policy window represented in its family payload | matching window ID/count/ordering; exact source identity/revision; opaque cursor/null under declared cursor mode | live revision/cursor do not mutate policy identity |
| `excluded_families` | capture records a selected family that was not observed | empty | every policy family is observed or appears once with exactly one of `unavailable`, `unsupported`, `redacted`, `unstable`; any entry forces top-level unstable/diagnostic-only or policy refusal | missing is never unchanged, observed, stable, or bounded |
| redaction dispositions | exact redaction policy owns disclosure; immutable disposition owns original/retained mapping | empty only when nothing matched | exact disposition pairs; original pointer/subtree, action/nullability matrix, matched rules, optional safe pre-fingerprint, retained pointer/ref/fingerprint, disposition fingerprint | no secret value, ambiguous path-prefix coverage, or retained field inside original subtree |
| retention policy | exact policy owns storage lifecycle | none | exact ref/fingerprint | no mutation of retained record bytes |
| `previous_snapshot` | exact predecessor rule selects the applicable prior boundary observation | `null` only when no eligible predecessor exists | exact ref/record fingerprint; same repository/workspace/boundary stream; recorded sequence is the greatest eligible value below current | no self/future/cycle/wrong-stream/wrong-boundary link or causal claim |
| `admissibility` | consistency rules derive allowed use | none | `grounding_and_evidence` for stable/bounded; `diagnostic_only` for unstable | never canonical/contract authority |
| `state_fingerprint` | Handbook derives selected observed-state identity | none | normalization below | no trigger/time/snapshot-ID sensitivity |
| `record_fingerprint` | Handbook derives complete immutable-record identity | none | normalization below | no mutable record after publication |

### Snapshot consistency

Supported consistency values:

- `stable` — selected authorities/revisions did not change during capture;
- `bounded` — every separately captured payload is bound to an exact immutable revision and cross-source skew satisfies the policy's explicit comparison bound;
- `unstable` — one or more authorities changed and the retry policy could not obtain a stable/bounded record.

Top-level consistency and admissibility are derived exactly:

| Observed family classifications | Selected-family exclusions | Top-level consistency | Admissibility/result |
|---|---|---|---|
| all `stable` | none | `stable` | `grounding_and_evidence` |
| at least one `bounded`, all others `stable` or `bounded`, every bound evaluation valid | none | `bounded` | `grounding_and_evidence` |
| any `unstable` | any | `unstable` | `diagnostic_only`, or no record when policy says `refuse` |
| all observed families `stable`/`bounded` | any `unavailable`, `unsupported`, `redacted`, or `unstable` exclusion | `unstable` | `diagnostic_only`, or no record when policy says `refuse` |

Field-level redaction within an otherwise observed family does not create a family exclusion; it remains represented by redaction dispositions and may coexist with stable/bounded source consistency. A whole selected family that cannot be represented is excluded and makes the capture incomplete, so it cannot be labeled grounding-and-evidence. The engine applies the table after retries; invocation cannot supply the top-level value or admissibility.

`stable` requires equal pre/captured/post revisions for every selected family, equal pre/captured/post revisions for every declared source slot, an exact family composite over those slot revisions, and `bound_evaluation: null`. A bounded family records `bound_evaluation` with the exact same bound-rule ref/fingerprint selected by the capture policy, evaluated composite/per-slot revision set, `within_bound` outcome, and evidence fingerprint; its payload must be attributable to `captured_revision`. A missing, substituted, or stale rule pair refuses bounded classification. A changed source is not `bounded` merely because the reader finished. An out-of-bound evaluation triggers the declared retry and ultimately `unstable`/diagnostic-only or refusal; it cannot ground a closeout, promotion, hard gate, or stable delta. Active-plan-only drift therefore changes the work composite and yields retry or unstable/stale refusal rather than a current work observation.

The bounded evaluation has this exact semantic shape:

```yaml
bound_evaluation:
  rule: { ref: handbook.snapshot-bound.exact-revision-per-family@1.0.0, fingerprint: sha256:... }
  evaluated_revisions:
    family_revision: composite:sha256:...
    source_slot_revisions: { work_ledger: "work:4", active_plan: "plan:4" }
  outcome: within_bound
  evidence_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

The `rule` pair must equal the capture policy's `consistency.bounded_skew_rule`; the evaluation is capture-local and therefore does not enter the reusable policy definition.

### Snapshot fingerprints

- `state_fingerprint` covers schema identity, repository/workspace identity, exact policy/profile/envelope fingerprints, every selected family composite and per-slot pre/captured/post revision, bound evaluation, window capture inputs, payload fingerprint, exclusions, and redaction outcomes. It excludes snapshot ID, boundary-stream ref, boundary sequence, trigger, timestamps, retry count, previous-snapshot link, and both fingerprint fields.
- `record_fingerprint` covers the normalized complete immutable record except itself.
- Map keys, paths, unordered semantic sets, work-item windows, and evidence refs use their contract-defined canonical deterministic ordering.
- Two records captured at different times may have equal state fingerprints.

### Snapshot authority

Snapshot Memory is descriptive evidence. It cannot:

- lock or mutate a contract;
- replace canonical artifacts;
- rewrite a queue or handoff;
- infer why a divergence occurred;
- pass claims beyond captured/observed state.

Snapshot refs in handoffs, evidence, deltas, and projections always include or resolve the exact `record_fingerprint`; a bare mutable snapshot ID is insufficient.

The policy's exact predecessor rule defines eligible trigger transitions and ordering within `boundary_stream_ref`. Sequence values are unique and strictly increasing within each repository/workspace/stream; concurrent allocation collision must retry or refuse rather than introduce a tie-breaker. When `previous_snapshot` is present it must be the highest eligible sequence lower than the current record and its recorded sequence must match the referenced record. Self-links, forward links, duplicate sequences, cycles, wrong-stream/workspace links, skipped eligible predecessors, and disallowed trigger transitions fail closed.

```

The two snapshots must have stable/bounded admissibility, the same repository/workspace identity, supported snapshot schema versions, and policies/state-family adapters admitted by the exact comparison contract. The delta's exact drift-rule catalog must equal the catalog selected by both endpoint policies or be explicitly admitted as compatible by that comparison contract. Every family selected by either policy is compared or appears once in `excluded_state_families` with `absent`, `redacted`, `unstable`, or `incompatible`. A missing family or path is never silently treated as unchanged.

Every change carries a deterministic stable key, typed change kind, and before/after fingerprints (`null` only for creation/deletion). Domain-specific derived lists such as completed work, queue changes, proof gates, artifacts, contracts, blockers, and handoff drift are views over this normalized change set, not second delta authorities.

Deterministic signal values:

- `expected_progress`;
- `justified_divergence`;
- `unexplained_drift`;
- `scope_expansion`;
- `execution_inefficiency_signal`;
- `planning_inaccuracy_signal`;
- `proof_drift`;
- `semantic_drift`;
- `stale_handoff`.

Every exact rule in the bound catalog is evaluated exactly once in catalog order and recorded in `rule_evaluations` as `matched`, `not_matched`, or `not_applicable`; applicability is owned by the rule definition, not the caller. Every matched evaluation names exactly one unique signal, every signal resolves back to exactly one matched evaluation with the same rule pair, and non-matched/not-applicable evaluations have null signal IDs. Missing, duplicate, stale, refused, or contradictory evaluation prevents delta creation. Thus `signals` is exactly the deterministic set of all matching catalog rules, including legitimate overlaps rather than a caller-selected subset.

Signals identify their stable ID, exact drift-rule ref/fingerprint, matching change IDs, evidence, and durable justification refs. Every signal rule is a member of the bound catalog. An uncataloged rule, stale catalog fingerprint, or catalog not selected/admitted by the endpoints and comparison contract refuses delta creation. `justified_divergence` requires at least one authoritative decision/handoff/escalation/child-packet justification ref admitted by its rule. Signals do not make an unreviewed causal claim, and free-form explanation never changes deterministic classification.

`delta_fingerprint` covers both exact snapshot input pairs, comparison contract, drift-rule catalog, compared/excluded families, normalized changes, complete rule evaluations, signals, and justification refs except itself. Reversing inputs is a different delta. Incompatible or unstable inputs refuse rather than emitting an empty/green delta.

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Snapshot-grounding Projection definition

Snapshot grounding uses an ordinary exact `ProjectionDefinition`; the required currentness-family set is base definition behavior, not an extension or request hint:

The request's `currentness.expected_family_revisions` and the result's `currentness_validation.checks` must each equal the definition's required family set exactly. Family IDs, source-selector IDs, adapters, and source-slot sets must match. Each request value is copied from the exact bound snapshot's captured composite/per-slot revisions, and every result observed value must equal it. Omission, extra entries, duplicate families, selector/adapter/slot substitution, or values not equal to the bound captured state refuses before output. Because this definition reveals the delta's unfiltered `/signals`, its currentness set covers every family compared by that delta, including `session`; a definition that omits one must instead filter/omit signals derived from unchecked families with typed proof effects.

These are specialized capitalized Projection DTOs, not a second projection model. Their schemas extend the generic request/result schemas without removing or renaming any generic required field. The example definition declares exactly-one `snapshot_current` and `snapshot_delta` selectors, so both entries appear in generic `sources`; a different exact definition may omit the delta selector entirely, but v1 never makes one exactly-one selector optional at request time. Snapshot sources use `fingerprint` for the exact record fingerprint and additionally carry `state_fingerprint`. Generic `resolution_envelope`, surface, operation, `disclosure_evaluations`, included/omissions/not-applicable/derivations, output, lossiness, authority, and result-fingerprint fields retain their generic meanings. The snapshot-grounding definition also declares the exact source families whose current revisions must be revalidated.

Additional snapshot-projection gates:

- included fields fit the target Resolution authority and detail horizons;
- omitted sensitive, unavailable, or out-of-scope fields remain enumerated with proof effect;
- comprehensive capture does not imply comprehensive disclosure;
- grounding projection never mutates the source snapshot;
- snapshot/delta fingerprints remain traceable through their generic source-selector entries;
- when the definition includes a `snapshot_delta` selector, that delta names the `snapshot_current` source as its `to_snapshot`;
- a caller that requires fresh capture completes it before constructing the Projection request, then binds the resulting exact snapshot/delta sources; every current-grounding request uses definition-matching `exact_revision_check`, the result retains identical sources and records one typed check per definition-required family including exact selector/composite/per-slot revisions, and any observed mismatch returns a typed stale refusal instead of a result.

| Specialized field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sources` entries for `snapshot_current`/`snapshot_delta` | immutable snapshot/delta own observed and changed state | exactly as declared by definition; both required in this example | generic exactly-one selector rules; exact fingerprints; snapshot stable/bounded; delta `to_snapshot` equals selected snapshot | no specialized alias, implicit optional selector, or full-record injection |
| definition disclosure policy/rule minima/classifications and result `disclosure_evaluations` | generic Projection disclosure contract owns metadata-only decision order; snapshot/delta dispositions own prior redaction | no specialization default; every generic field remains required | exact policy/fingerprint; complete six-dimension/classification rules; one replayable evaluation per applicable rule; covering upstream action maps original pointer to `redacted`; no protected read before allow | no snapshot-only policy, `unavailable` downgrade, hidden reread, content sniff, or disclosure field drop |
| specialized included/omission/not-applicable/derivation/output | generic Projection contract owns view semantics | as generic contract | all generic disjoint rule accounting plus exact snapshot/delta provenance | no second snapshot-only projection semantics |
| request `currentness` | snapshot-grounding definition owns tuple set/basis; bound snapshot owns expected values | none; mode `exact_revision_check`, basis `captured_revision` | mode/basis equal definition; tuples equal definition; values equal exact bound snapshot family/slot captured revisions | no caller-supplied alternate live value, omitted/extra family, selector/adapter/slot substitution, placeholder source, or post-request substitution |
| result `currentness_validation` | source adapters own current observed revisions; engine records proof | none | check set equals definition/request; expected values equal bound captured state; observed equals expected; all `current`; request/result sources identical | no result on stale/partial validation, plan/session-only drift, or bounded captured/post mismatch |

V1 has no caller-selected family or rule subset. For the requested operation, the exact definition's applicable field rules are the complete rule set that must be evaluated and partitioned. The resolved envelope, redaction policy, source availability, and schema support yield the already-defined typed omissions with their proof effects; they never yield `not_applicable` and do not remove a rule from accounting. Operation mismatch alone yields `not_applicable`. An `include_families` field or any other caller-supplied subset selector is unknown input and produces a typed refusal with no Projection result.

`currentness_validation` is included in `result_fingerprint`. Fresh capture is a pre-request operation: only after it completes may its exact snapshot fingerprint populate `sources`. The engine never swaps that source after request construction. The engine reads captured values from that bound record before observing live revisions; it never trusts caller equality alone. In a bounded snapshot whose captured and post revisions differ, exact-current grounding refuses unless the live observed value again equals the captured value. A mismatch, missing family, unchecked delta-signal family, stale adapter, unavailable check, placeholder pre-capture source, or request/result source difference emits a typed refusal with no Projection output/result fingerprint.

## Snapshot redaction and retention

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.snapshot-redaction-policy
schema_version: "1.0"
policy_id: handbook.snapshot-redaction.default
policy_version: "1.0.0"
fail_closed: true
unmatched_action: omit
rules:
  - rule_id: secret_values
    matcher: { surface_kind: classified_secret, selector: "*" }
    action: omit
  - rule_id: unrestricted_environment
    matcher: { surface_kind: environment_value, selector: unrestricted }
    action: omit
  - rule_id: secret_files
    matcher: { surface_kind: secret_file, selector: "**" }
    action: omit
  - rule_id: raw_command_arguments
    matcher: { surface_kind: command_argument, selector: raw }
    action: omit
  - rule_id: raw_command_output
    matcher: { surface_kind: command_output, selector: unrestricted }
    action: omit
  - rule_id: unrestricted_diff
    matcher: { surface_kind: repository_diff, selector: unrestricted_full_content }
    action: omit
  - rule_id: environment_metadata
    matcher: { surface_kind: environment_value, selector: allowlisted_non_secret }
    action: fingerprint_only
extensions: {}
policy_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

Actions are `omit`, `fingerprint_only`, `artifact_ref_only`, or `redacted_summary`. V1 requires `fail_closed: true` and `unmatched_action: omit`; unknown classification, matcher failure, and a known surface matching no rule therefore all omit. Rule order makes matching replay-stable but does not select among actions. Multiple matching rules with the same action are valid; if any matching action is `omit`, `omit` wins; two or more distinct matching non-omit actions are incomparable and capture refuses.

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.snapshot-redaction-disposition
schema_version: "1.0"
disposition_id: snapshot-redaction-disposition.example
source_family: session
source_adapter: { ref: handbook.snapshot-source.session@1.0.0, fingerprint: sha256:... }
original_pointer: /family_observations/session/payload/environment/PATH
matched_rule_ids: [environment_metadata]
action: fingerprint_only
reason: matched_policy
pre_redaction_value_fingerprint: sha256:...
retained:
  kind: fingerprint
  pointer: /family_observations/session/payload/environment_fingerprints/PATH
  content_ref: null
  content_fingerprint: sha256:...
disposition_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

Every snapshot `redaction.dispositions` entry is an exact `{ref, fingerprint}` pair to one immutable disposition. `original_pointer` is the exact JSON Pointer hidden by the action and covers that pointer plus its descendants by JSON Pointer segment boundaries, never by string-prefix matching. `retained` uses this exact action matrix:

| `action` | `retained.kind` | `retained.pointer` | `retained.content_ref` | `retained.content_fingerprint` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `omit` | `none` | `null` | `null` | `null` |
| `fingerprint_only` | `fingerprint` | required | `null` | required |
| `artifact_ref_only` | `artifact_ref` | required | required | required |
| `redacted_summary` | `redacted_summary` | required | required | required |

A non-null retained pointer is a schema-valid pointer outside the original pointer's subtree; it may share earlier path segments but is never equal to or a descendant of `original_pointer`. Therefore the disposition covers the original value/subtree only and never automatically covers the retained field. Projection maps a request for the original pointer or its descendants to `redacted` with zero value reads, while a request for the exact retained pointer evaluates that retained field independently through its own rule classification and disclosure policy. Matched rule IDs retain policy order. `pre_redaction_value_fingerprint` is non-null only when safe to compute. `disposition_fingerprint` covers the normalized complete record and exact adapter fingerprint except itself. Missing/ambiguous original/retained mapping, action-nullability mismatch, duplicate disposition identity, or a retained pointer inside the original subtree refuses snapshot creation.

By default snapshots exclude:

- secret values and credential material;
- unrestricted environment variables;
- `.env` and secret-file contents;
- raw command arguments/output that may carry secrets;
- full diffs when normalized statistics/fingerprints and evidence refs suffice.

No invocation flag may weaken those floors. A stricter selected policy may omit more.

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.snapshot-retention-policy
schema_version: "1.0"
policy_id: handbook.snapshot-retention.session
policy_version: "1.0.0"
rules:
  - rule_id: strategic_milestone
    memory_horizons: [strategic]
    triggers: [gate_complete, publish]
    record_classes: [context_memory_snapshot]
    action: retain_indefinitely
    minimum_retention_seconds: null
  - rule_id: execution_session
    memory_horizons: [execution, operation]
    triggers: [session_start, session_end]
    record_classes: [context_memory_snapshot]
    action: retention_window
    minimum_retention_seconds: 2592000
deduplication: content_addressed_payload_only
compaction:
  allowed: true
  requires_review: true
  preserve_source_refs: true
extensions: {}
policy_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

Retention actions are `retain_indefinitely` or `retention_window`; content-addressed payload deduplication is a storage optimization, not a record action. Every `(memory_horizon, trigger, record_class)` selected by the capture policy resolves exactly one retention rule. A record referenced by a handoff, evidence, verdict, gate, active promotion, legal hold, or unexpired stricter rule cannot be deleted. Deduplication preserves distinct record identities. Compaction creates a new reviewed aggregate with exact source ref/fingerprint pairs and never rewrites retained source bytes.

Both policy fingerprints use uniform exact-definition identity over the normalized policy and referenced matcher/classification definitions, including `unmatched_action` and excluding only their own fingerprint. Secret fixtures and unsafe paths/arguments/output must have explicit negative tests before implementation gates can close.

| Field family | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| policy schema/identity | Handbook schema registry and policy author | none | exact schema; stable ID plus SemVer; unique exact ref | no ambient/latest policy |
| redaction `fail_closed`/`unmatched_action`/rules | security policy owns minimum disclosure | v1 requires true/`omit`/non-empty | explicit secret, unrestricted environment, secret-file, raw command argument/output, and unrestricted full-diff floors; known matcher surfaces/actions; identical overlap valid; `omit` wins; distinct non-omit overlap refuses | no undeclared action ranking, permissive unmatched surface, invocation weakening, or secret-bearing diagnostic |
| redaction dispositions | capture engine records immutable applied/default outcomes | empty matched-rule IDs only for default omission | exact source adapter; original JSON Pointer/subtree; action-specific retained kind/pointer/ref/fingerprint; policy-order matched IDs; safe pre-fingerprint; disposition fingerprint; snapshot stores exact pair | no hidden omission, string-prefix coverage, ambiguous original/retained identity, retained descendant, or later mutation |
| retention rules | retention authority owns minimum storage lifetime by horizon/trigger/record-class tuple | none | every selected tuple resolves exactly one rule without overlap; known record class; positive window when used | no automatic deletion policy from frequency alone |
| deduplication/compaction | storage policy owns safe physical optimization | dedupe optional; compaction disabled unless explicit | distinct records preserved; reviewed aggregate/source refs; holds/references/floors honored | no byte rewrite or authority merge |
| policy fingerprints | Handbook derives exact policy identity | none | normalized policy plus exact referenced matcher/classification fingerprints except itself | no unchanged fingerprint after semantic drift |

### Shared HCM-0.3 extension rule

Every HCM-0.3 definition that exposes `extensions` uses the same field contract: the declaring record schema owns namespaced optional additions; the default is an explicit empty map; each populated namespace resolves an exact extension schema and may add only optional semantics; the complete normalized map and extension-schema fingerprints enter the record's definition/policy fingerprint. Unknown required behavior, unregistered namespaces, executable hooks, remote code, and extensions that weaken a base invariant fail closed. Records that do not show an `extensions` field do not accept one.

| Field | Owner and authority | Default/omission | Required validation | Explicit non-goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HCM-0.3 `extensions` | declaring schema owns namespaced optional additions | explicit empty map | registered exact extension schemas; optional-only semantics; included in enclosing fingerprint closure | no unknown required behavior, base-rule override, executable hook, or ambient namespace |

### HCM-0.3 required conformance scenarios

Later implementation packets must turn these design examples into mechanical schema/semantic tests:

| Contract | Positive scenarios | Negative/fail-closed scenarios |
|---|---|---|
| stack/envelope | compare every adjacent level across all six domains; equal/narrow child; exact and wildcard allow/deny overlap resolves deny | one rank increase; malformed/indeterminate selector; stale parent; changed stack/profile |
| escalation/promotion transitions | request-only pending state followed by exactly one terminal disposition; approval/application creates exact new envelope/memory result while prior bytes replay unchanged | in-place status/outcome mutation; duplicate disposition; reused ID with changed bytes; stale request; invalid outcome-specific nullability |
| Projection sources | one exact source identity per typed selector; canonical artifacts and immutable semantic/observation records including snapshot/delta sources retain their authority class; definition belongs to resolved-profile catalog; target schema, allowed surfaces/operations, mandatory currentness, profile stack/catalog, and source/schema/kind/capability closure resolve | zero/multiple identity matches; source-order fallback; snapshot/delta rejected merely for being non-canonical or promoted to canonical/peer authority; definition absent from profile catalog; unresolved source/target schema; catalog gate invents a source-role or target-level field absent from `ProjectionDefinition` |
| Projection disclosure | same canonical/snapshot/delta rule included under a sufficient envelope and `out_of_resolution` under a narrower envelope; matched allow/redact plus registered-unmatched redaction; evaluator fingerprint recomputes from exact dependencies/input/reason order, supported/unsupported plus first reason replay metadata-only, and evaluator-only drift changes evaluator/definition/profile/evaluation/result fingerprints; exact evaluation-outcome/nullability matrix and mixed-rule ordering replay; all four upstream actions map original pointer/subtree to `redacted`; retained fields sharing path segments evaluate independently; protected-source spy records zero reads before allow | unregistered definition classification accepted or converted to result; missing/stale/incompatible policy, classification registry, evaluator, or evaluator dependency produces a result; ambient evaluator substitution; unsupported free-form/wrong-precedence reason; incomplete/invalid minimum ranks; permissive registered-unmatched tuple; action-nullability/ordinal/fingerprint mismatch; string-prefix original/retained confusion; upstream redaction mapped `unavailable`; hidden payload reread; fingerprint unchanged after disclosure/support drift |
| Projection accounting/lossiness | request-operation partitions definition rules exactly across included/omissions/not-applicable; exactly bound fields denied by envelope, redacted, unavailable, or runtime-unsupported produce typed omissions; every reason crosses required/non-required plus empty/non-empty claims using the exact proof-effect/output-schema table; non-lossy/lossy derivations; each mixed-reason precedence row | request-wide envelope-visibility precondition; valid bound applicable source refused solely for envelope/redaction/availability/support; target schema cannot represent typed absence; missing/duplicate rule accounting; those four outcomes classified `not_applicable`; non-operation applicability condition; caller-selected lossiness; required omission suppresses result or falsely passes |
| capture windows/families | same policy with changed live source revisions/cursors produces new snapshot fingerprints; exclusive cursor boundary replay; selected families equal observed plus excluded; work windows bind declared slots | revision/cursor mutates policy identity; ambient extra family; silently missing family/slot |
| consistency | all-stable/no-exclusion aggregation; mixed stable/bounded/no-exclusion aggregation; exact composite/per-slot revisions and policy-selected bound evaluation | any excluded/unstable family labeled stable/bounded or grounding; active-plan-only drift; substituted/stale bound rule; out-of-bound retry; completed-read-only bounded claim |
| predecessor | valid immediate prior-end/new-start or start/end boundary transition with unique strictly increasing sequence under exact rule | self, future, duplicate sequence/collision tie-breaker, cycle, skipped eligible predecessor, wrong stream/workspace/trigger |
| delta | every selected family appears once in compared/excluded; normalized changes replay; every catalog rule is evaluated once and matched evaluations map bijectively to signals | incompatible/unstable inputs; missing family treated unchanged; reversed input equivalence; uncataloged signal; omitted/duplicate/contradictory evaluation; stale/incompatible catalog |
| snapshot Projection | definition owns the complete operation rule set and captured-revision family/selector/adapter/slot closure; request values equal bound snapshot captured state; observations equal request; unfiltered delta signals cover every compared family; fresh capture precedes request | caller family/rule subset selector including unknown `include_families`; stale snapshot plus unrelated equal live values; bounded captured/post mismatch; session-only drift; unchecked-family signal; omitted/extra/duplicate tuple; selector/adapter/slot mismatch; post-request substitution; incomplete rule accounting |
| redaction | identical-action overlap; `omit` overlap; explicit sensitive-surface floors; unknown, matcher-failed, and known-unmatched surfaces default to omit; every action satisfies exact original/retained pointer/nullability matrix including containing-value coverage and shared-prefix retained fields | distinct non-omit overlap; permissive unmatched surface; known-unmatched environment/secret-file/command/diff content retained; retained pointer equal to/under original subtree; ambiguous prefix coverage; action/nullability mismatch |
| retention | every allowed memory-horizon/declared-trigger/context-memory-snapshot tuple resolves exactly one rule | envelope horizon outside policy; uncovered/overlapping tuple; deletion under reference/hold/floor |
| field matrix | mechanical example-key-to-owning matrix coverage including shared `extensions` | undefined fingerprint input or unmatrixed semantic field |

## Project posture kernel and recommendation contracts

V1 posture levels are global per registered engineering dimension. A `causal_scope_ref` records where trigger evidence applies, but it is not a second posture-state coordinate, does not select a scoped level, and never changes the constitutional authority path. If scoped posture state is later required, it needs a separate contract and migration.

### Posture trigger definition

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.posture-trigger-definition
schema_version: "1.0"
trigger_id: handbook.posture-trigger.public-api-critical
trigger_version: "1.0.0"
trigger_kind: hard
signal_input:
  ref: handbook.signal.public-api-risk@1.0.0
  fingerprint: sha256:...
evidence_requirement_input:
  ref: handbook.evidence-requirement.public-api-risk@1.0.0
  fingerprint: sha256:...
freshness_policy_input:
  ref: handbook.freshness.release-risk@1.0.0
  fingerprint: sha256:...
dimension_id: testing_rigor
causal_scope_ref: artifact.public_api
proposed_transition:
  from: 4
  to: 5
default_confidence: high
default_urgency: before_next_release
required_approval_ref: charter.governance.project_owner
suggested_actions: []
trigger_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

A hard trigger is an immutable versioned definition. `trigger_fingerprint` is SHA-256 over every normalized field except itself and includes the exact signal, evidence-requirement, and freshness-policy fingerprints. One trigger binds one global dimension transition and one causal scope. It cannot authorize mutation, notification delivery, a second dimension, or a scoped authority path.

### Freshness evaluation basis

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.freshness-evaluation-basis
schema_version: "1.0"
basis_id: freshness_basis_...
evaluated_at_utc: "..."
source_states:
  - source_ref: evidence.public-api-risk
    source_fingerprint: sha256:...
    freshness_policy_ref: handbook.freshness.release-risk@1.0.0
    freshness_policy_fingerprint: sha256:...
    valid_from_utc: "..."
    expires_at_utc: "..."
    classification: fresh
basis_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

The freshness basis is an immutable deterministic semantic input, not Snapshot Memory. `classification` is `fresh`, `stale`, or `unknown` as of the explicit evaluation instant under the exact policy. Its fingerprint covers the evaluation instant, every source ref/fingerprint, freshness-policy ref/fingerprint, validity bound, and classification; it excludes `basis_id` and its own fingerprint. Reusing the same basis is stable. Evaluating before versus after expiry produces a different basis/fingerprint.

### Project posture kernel

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.project-posture-kernel
schema_version: "1.0"
kernel_id: posture_kernel_...
constitutional_artifact_ref: .handbook/example/root.yaml
constitutional_artifact_fingerprint: sha256:...
profile_ref: handbook.profile.example@1.0.0
resolved_profile_fingerprint: sha256:...
override_inputs: []
condition_inputs: []
contract_inputs: []
evidence_inputs:
  - ref: evidence.public-api-risk
    fingerprint: sha256:...
snapshot_inputs: []
freshness_basis_ref: freshness_basis_...
freshness_basis_fingerprint: sha256:...
dimensions:
  testing_rigor:
    level: 4
    floor: 3
    red_line_refs: []
    trigger_refs: []
    allowed_shortcut_refs: []
    proof_obligation_refs: []
applicable_scope_refs: []
omitted_condition_refs: []
unresolved_condition_refs: []
recommendation_refs: []
resolved_at_utc: "..."
input_fingerprint: sha256:...
kernel_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

`ProjectPostureKernel` is derived, not independently editable canonical truth. Every `*_inputs` entry is a typed `{ref, fingerprint}` pair. `input_fingerprint` covers schema identity, constitutional ref/fingerprint, exact profile ref plus `resolved_profile_fingerprint`, every normalized input pair, and the freshness-basis ref/fingerprint whenever any input is freshness-qualified. It excludes `kernel_id`, resolved output, recommendation refs, `resolved_at_utc`, and both fingerprint fields. `kernel_fingerprint` covers `input_fingerprint` plus global dimension state, applicability/explanation refs, and other resolved semantic output; it excludes `kernel_id`, recommendation refs, `resolved_at_utc`, and its own field. Lists whose order has no meaning are sorted by stable keys before hashing. Changed bytes behind a stable ref require a changed fingerprint or refusal.

### Posture evaluation policy

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.posture-evaluation-policy
schema_version: "1.0"
policy_id: handbook.posture-policy.example
policy_version: "1.0.0"
hard_trigger_inputs:
  - ref: handbook.posture-trigger.public-api-critical@1.0.0
    fingerprint: sha256:...
accumulated_signal_rules:
  - rule_id: repeated_release_regressions
    signal_input:
      ref: handbook.signal.release-regression@1.0.0
      fingerprint: sha256:...
    evidence_requirement_input:
      ref: handbook.evidence-requirement.release-regression@1.0.0
      fingerprint: sha256:...
    freshness_policy_input:
      ref: handbook.freshness.release-risk@1.0.0
      fingerprint: sha256:...
    dimension_id: testing_rigor
    causal_scope_ref: artifact.public_api
    comparator: at_least
    threshold: 3
    window: P30D
    minimum_observations: 3
    proposed_transition:
      from: 4
      to: 5
    default_confidence: high
    default_urgency: before_next_release
    required_approval_ref: charter.governance.project_owner
    suggested_actions: []
    rule_fingerprint: sha256:...
lowering_evidence_window: P90D
cooldown: P30D
recipient_refs:
  - charter.governance.project_owner
acknowledgment_required: true
escalate_after: P7D
extensions: {}
policy_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

Each accumulated rule is local to one exact policy version. `rule_fingerprint` covers every normalized rule field and cited input fingerprint except itself. A recommendation cites the policy pair, `rule_id`, and `rule_fingerprint`; it does not invent a synthetic external trigger ref. `policy_fingerprint` covers normalized policy identity/configuration, ordered hard-trigger pairs, accumulated rules including their fingerprints, notification semantics, hysteresis, extensions, and referenced definition fingerprints, excluding only itself. Hard triggers and accumulated rules each bind one global dimension transition and one causal scope.

### Posture recommendation

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.posture-recommendation
schema_version: "1.0"
recommendation_id: posture_rec_...
kernel_ref: posture_kernel_...
kernel_fingerprint: sha256:...
evaluation_policy_ref: handbook.posture-policy.example@1.0.0
evaluation_policy_fingerprint: sha256:...
proposed_transition:
  dimension_id: testing_rigor
  from: 4
  to: 5
causal_scope_ref: artifact.public_api
trigger_source:
  kind: hard_trigger
  ref: handbook.posture-trigger.public-api-critical@1.0.0
  fingerprint: sha256:...
  rule_id: null
  rule_fingerprint: null
triggering_observations:
  - public API blast radius is critical
evidence_inputs:
  - ref: evidence.public-api-risk
    fingerprint: sha256:...
snapshot_delta_inputs: []
confidence: high
urgency: before_next_release
required_approval_ref: charter.governance.project_owner
notification:
  recipient_refs:
    - charter.governance.project_owner
  acknowledgment_required: true
  escalate_after: P7D
suggested_actions: []
promotion_eligibility: recommendation_only
recommendation_fingerprint: sha256:...
```

V1 permits exactly one `proposed_transition` per recommendation. For `trigger_source.kind: hard_trigger`, `ref` and `fingerprint` are required and both rule fields are null. For `accumulated_rule`, the trigger ref/fingerprint fields are null while `rule_id` and `rule_fingerprint` identify a rule inside the cited exact policy. The transition, causal scope, confidence, urgency, approval, actions, evidence/freshness requirements, and notification must match the selected trigger/rule and policy. Two dimension changes produce two recommendations; recommendation grouping is presentation-only.

### Posture transition

Recommendation and transition gates:

- every recommendation cites one current kernel/policy pair, one exact hard trigger or accumulated rule, and sufficient exact evidence inputs;
- hard triggers and accumulated rules remain distinct; unexplained snapshot drift cannot silently become causal evidence;
- a causal event requiring multiple dimensions produces separate recommendations with independent approvals and fingerprints;
- recommendations are advisory and never modify canonical Charter or override state;
- lowering requires configured sustained evidence and cooldown and cannot cross floors or red lines;
- notification delivery is adapter-owned and cannot change recipient, acknowledgment, approval, or escalation semantics;
- only an authorized compare-and-write `PostureTransition` revalidates mapped intake coverage, updates the canonical constitutional-root authority atomically, and re-resolves the kernel; override mutation is refused in v1;
- a failed, stale, unapproved, fingerprint-mismatched, scoped-path, or invalid transition leaves canonical authority unchanged and returns a typed refusal.

Required conformance scenarios for later implementation packets:

| Scenario | Required result |
|---|---|
| same semantic sources and same freshness basis resolve twice | identical input/kernel fingerprints and global dimensions |
| parent/repository profile changes behind same selected profile ref | old `resolved_profile_fingerprint` refuses; new one changes kernel input fingerprint |
| source/policy/trigger bytes change behind same ref | stale fingerprint refuses; new fingerprint changes dependent identities |
| same sources evaluated immediately before and after expiry | different basis/input fingerprints; classification/output changes honestly |
| hard trigger and normalized policy resolve twice | identical trigger/policy fingerprints |
| accumulated rule misses count/window/freshness threshold | no recommendation |
| accumulated rule meets exact bounded semantics | recommendation cites policy/rule fingerprints and exact evidence |
| one event warrants two dimension changes | two recommendations, never one multi-transition record |
| causal scope differs while global dimension state is the same | scope is retained as evidence metadata; `from` still reads the global dimension |
| recommendation notification differs from policy or guidance differs from trigger/rule | refusal |
| lowering lacks sustained window/cooldown or crosses floor/red line | refusal |
| transition path is scoped/outside binding, operation is not `replace`, or target is an override | refusal without canonical mutation |
| transition expected value/kernel/target/recommendation fingerprint is stale | compare-and-write refusal |
| actor/approval, mapped reassessment proof, or resulting-kernel fingerprint is missing/mismatched | invalid transition proof and no success claim |

## Optional synthesis-candidate contract

If later approved:

```yaml
operation: synthesize_candidate
producer:
  adapter: unified-agent-api
  provider_family: codex
  model: "..."
input_projection_refs: []
prompt_contract_ref: "..."
candidate_artifact_ref: "..."
promotion_eligibility: requires_review_and_lock
```

The exact UAA model/provider contract is loaded from the live `unified-agent-api` repository only for that future slice.

## Development orchestration contracts

These contracts govern development of Handbook through this control pack. They do not define a Handbook product-runtime agent engine.

### Dispatch execution envelope

The only normative current machine example is
`handoffs/internal-dispatch-template.json`. It is validated against
`handoffs/internal-dispatch.v1.1.schema.json` by `validate_handoffs.py`; do not
maintain a second partial YAML shape that can drift from the schema. Every
current internal dispatch includes the complete identity and timing fields,
parent and source lineage, execution contract, ordered skill chain, explicit
phase/slice/packet authority, replayable subject manifest, active Resolution,
authority and repo-truth statements, bounded scope/tasks/gates/stops, and the
complete structured return contract.

`execution_target` is one of:

- `internal_subagent` — default for delegable implementation, documentation, proof, remediation, and review work; the active parent executes it immediately through built-in subagent tools;
- `top_level_resume` — used only when a genuine context/runtime or authorization boundary requires another top-level task;
- `human_interactive` — used only when the next action requires user judgment, interactive observation, approval, or another non-delegable human action.

Rules:

1. `internal_subagent` uses the built-in fresh `default` agent capability with isolated context; shell-launched Codex processes, background jobs, temporary-file reviewer transport, and filesystem polling do not satisfy it.
2. Every dispatch declares an ordered `required_skills` chain beginning with `using-agent-skills`; the resolved skill workflows are mandatory, not advisory labels.
3. Review agents are read-only and receive authority, diff/evidence, gates, and non-goals without implementation reasoning or prior reviewer conclusions.
4. Internal agents return structured results to the parent and never append the global handoff ledger.
5. The parent validates findings against live truth, remediates valid findings directly or through a fresh fix agent, reruns verification, and sends the resulting state to a different fresh reviewer.
6. The parent owns integration, control-pack truth, final proof, commit, and top-level closeout.

### Parent-owned delegated-run evidence

New top-level handoffs record each proof-relevant built-in delegation:

```json
{
  "run_id": "review-round-1",
  "dispatch_id": "20260714T120000Z--HCM-0-1--independent-review",
  "dispatch_ref": "docs/specs/handbook-contract-membrane/handoffs/dispatches/20260714T120000Z--HCM-0-1--independent-review.json",
  "dispatch_fingerprint": "sha256:...",
  "role": "review",
  "agent_id": "independent_review",
  "agent_type": "default",
  "fresh_context": true,
  "required_skills": ["using-agent-skills", "code-review-and-quality"],
  "subject_fingerprint": "sha256:...",
  "result_subject_fingerprint": "sha256:...",
  "review_round": 1,
  "predecessor_run_id": null,
  "remediation_for_run_ids": [],
  "final_status": "completed",
  "verdict": "clean",
  "finding_refs": [],
  "evidence_refs": ["docs/specs/handbook-contract-membrane/handoffs/dispatches/...json"]
}
```

Handoff schema v1.2 adds required `orchestration_id`, `source_handoff_ids`, `delegation_capability`, `delegated_runs`, typed `remediations`, `reviewed_state`, `stop_reason`, and `resume`. `stop_reason` is one of `completed`, `human_input`, `external_blocker`, `authority_boundary`, `context_boundary`, or `capability_unavailable`.

A v1.2 handoff with `status: completed` must use `stop_reason: completed`, contain a completed clean fresh review run bound to `reviewed_state.subject_fingerprint` and its replayable manifest, and require no top-level resume. Human, external, authority, context, and capability stop reasons map to explicit permitted status/resume targets; v1.2 cannot emit historical `review_required`. A `capability_unavailable` stop is `blocked`. Dispatch/result parent, slice, packet, role, skills, and subject fingerprints must match. Earlier records and schemas remain immutable historical evidence.

The subject manifest sorts repository-relative paths and encodes each entry as `path + NUL + lowercase SHA-256 + newline`; the aggregate is SHA-256 over the concatenated encoded entries. Dispatch validation always recomputes the aggregate from the stored entries. At execution, the parent and reviewer verify every entry against the live subject. A completed v1.2 closeout verifies the final clean manifest against `reviewed_state.baseline_head`, the primary reviewed commit, while ledger parity is validated separately against the post-closeout record set. This preserves exact review binding even when the mechanical second commit adds the parent record and rebuilds `ledger.jsonl`. Earlier review manifests remain immutable identities of superseded pre-remediation subjects and are not incorrectly compared with the later repaired tree.

`delegation_capability.status: unavailable` and `stop_reason: capability_unavailable` are bidirectionally coupled. Unavailable mandatory delegation cannot be hidden under a human, external, authority, or context stop reason.

Every findings review in a completed closeout has a typed remediation record. Its owner is either `parent_orchestrator` with durable evidence or a completed delegated `remediation` run. The remediation names the findings run, result fingerprint, and different-fresh completed re-review run. That re-review may itself report findings; if it does, it receives its own typed remediation and another different fresh review. The last completed review must be clean. Failed or wrong-role work cannot satisfy remediation lineage.

### Review choreography

```text
implement or document
  -> verify
  -> fresh read-only reviewer
      -> clean: proof wall and closeout
      -> actionable findings:
           validate findings
           -> parent repair or fresh remediation agent
           -> verify
           -> different fresh reviewer
           -> repeat until clean or genuinely blocked
```

The orchestrator may not self-approve. A dispatch artifact proves a bounded job was specified; only captured built-in agent identity/status plus reconciled results prove that the job was executed.

## SDK command contract

Every ordinary use case has:

- a typed request;
- a typed result;
- structured expected blocked/refused states;
- a stable operation identifier;
- schema and capability versions;
- deterministic serialization.

Snapshot use cases should include capture, compare/delta, project, inspect, and verify-current operations without forcing callers to parse git or handoff prose themselves.

Artifact/intake use cases should include kind/instance discovery, structural/semantic validation, coverage inspection, evidence/declaration submission, candidate validation, promotion, projection, posture inspection, and recommendation acknowledgment. Operation IDs remain generic and select kind/instance IDs; custom kinds and vocabulary never create or rename CLI commands.

Proposed common response envelope:

```json
{
  "schema_id": "handbook.command-response",
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "operation": "contract.verify",
  "status": "ok",
  "data": {},
  "diagnostics": [],
  "next_actions": [],
  "artifact_refs": [],
  "provenance": {}
}
```

Status values:

- `ok`;
- `blocked`;
- `refused`;
- `error`.

Domain verdicts such as contract `fail` remain inside `data`; they are not collapsed into process/transport failure.

## CLI JSON contract

For every nontrivial command in JSON mode:

1. stdout contains exactly one complete JSON response document;
2. human progress and logs use stderr;
3. expected blocked/refused outcomes still serialize the envelope;
4. exit codes are stable and separately documented;
5. no ANSI styling appears in JSON;
6. large/binary outputs use artifact references;
7. the response reports capability/schema versions;
8. human output renders from the same typed result.

The initial Substrate CLI bridge consumes this contract only. It never parses human text.

## Contract record

```yaml
schema_id: handbook.contract
schema_version: "1.0"
contract_id: example.operation.v1
kind: operation
status: locked
authority_resolution: coordination
subject: {}
claims: []
required_evidence: []
scoring: {}
```

Lifecycle target:

```text
draft -> review_ready -> locked -> active -> passed|blocked -> closed
                                  \-> deprecated
```

Lifecycle transitions require typed evidence and authority. A rendered document or passing test cannot lock or close a contract by itself.

## Evidence record

Evidence identifies:

- contract and claim refs;
- producer/dock identity and version;
- subject and case;
- observed facts;
- artifact/trace refs;
- source fingerprints;
- Context Resolution envelope;
- included and unobserved claims;
- execution provenance;
- confidence/flakiness where applicable.
- snapshot and delta refs when point-in-time state supports the observation.

## Verdict contract

Supported verdicts:

- `pass`;
- `fail`;
- `blocked`;
- `warning`;
- `not_observed`;
- `not_applicable`;
- `flaky`.

Rules:

- hard-fail severity blocks regardless of aggregate score;
- required `not_observed` cannot become pass through weighting;
- evidence outside the required Resolution/subject boundary cannot satisfy a claim;
- flaky evidence remains visible and cannot silently average into green;
- verdicts cite evidence records.

## Gate contract

A gate identifies:

- target contract and lifecycle transition;
- claim verdicts;
- hard blockers;
- weighted score if used;
- local closeout eligibility;
- parent promotion eligibility;
- remediation/next actions;
- evidence and projection refs.
- snapshot/delta refs used for grounding, staleness, or drift decisions.

Local completion and broader promotion are separate decisions.

## Dock capability manifest

```json
{
  "schema_id": "handbook.dock-capability",
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "dock_id": "example.validator",
  "dock_protocol_versions": ["1.0"],
  "contract_kinds": ["operation"],
  "evidence_kinds": ["schema_validation"],
  "input_media_types": ["application/json"],
  "resolution_support": {
    "minimum_level": "execution",
    "dimensions": ["scope_horizon", "detail_resolution", "validation_horizon"]
  },
  "execution": {
    "mode": "process",
    "supports_timeout": true,
    "supports_cancellation": true
  }
}
```

## Dock request/result

Request includes:

- protocol and schema versions;
- contract and selected claim refs;
- Resolution envelope;
- canonical/projection/evidence artifact refs;
- snapshot/delta refs when the validator needs a point-in-time state boundary;
- workspace capability grant;
- timeout/cancellation policy;
- requested evidence types.

Result includes:

- dock identity/version;
- structured status/refusal;
- normalized evidence refs;
- observed/unobserved claim refs;
- diagnostics;
- produced artifact refs;
- exact Resolution/provenance;
- execution timing and completion state.

## Public API proof gates

### CLI bridge gate

- exact Handbook binary version;
- exact JSON schema/capability versions;
- real Substrate seam;
- no human-output parsing;
- explicit replacement boundary.

### Published Rust API gate

A downstream-intended API is complete only when:

1. relevant crates are published to crates.io;
2. a registry-only external consumer resolves exact versions;
3. a dedicated Substrate worktree from current tip imports those exact versions;
4. a real seam uses the API;
5. the proof wall passes;
6. no sibling-path or unpublished fallback exists.

The CLI bridge may ship earlier, but it cannot satisfy this Rust API gate.

## Schema compatibility posture

This greenfield program does not promise compatibility with legacy Handbook artifact formats.

Compatibility rules apply only after a new schema/API is deliberately published as supported. Temporary internal cutover types must name their deletion gate and cannot become implicit public contracts.
