# Dispatch: Replace With Exact Objective

## Mission

Execute exactly the bounded objective below. Do not widen into sibling work.

## Active Context Resolution

- Level:
- Scope horizon:
- Detail resolution:
- Temporal horizon:
- Authority horizon:
- Memory horizon:
- Validation horizon:

## Authority Order

1. Slice-local `SPEC.md`, `tasks/plan.md`, and `tasks/todo.md`
2. Exact control-pack sections named below
3. Live code/tests for current implementation truth
4. Idea/archive context only when explicitly named

## Must Read

- Replace with exact pack sections.
- Replace with exact live files/tests.
- Read the source handoff record.

## Current Repo-Truth Statement

Replace with the freshly verified current boundary and semantic status.

## Allowed Scope

- Replace with exact paths/capabilities.

## Explicit Non-Goals

- Unrelated cleanup.
- Adjacent slice implementation.
- User migration tooling or implicit legacy compatibility.

## Tasks and Deliverables

1. Replace with exact ordered work.

## Contracts and Proof Gates

- Replace with exact `05` contract sections.
- Replace with exact `06` proof gates.

## Stop and Escalate When

- Target docs and live truth conflict in a behavior-changing way.
- Work requires a broader authority or Resolution horizon.
- A finding requires cross-document repair or child-packet decomposition.
- The required proof cannot be produced inside this packet.

## Mandatory Closeout

Before responding in chat:

1. write one immutable handoff record under `docs/specs/handbook-contract-membrane/handoffs/records/`;
2. update `handoffs/ledger.jsonl` according to `08-handoff-ledger-and-escalation-protocol.md`;
3. keep the chat response to status, handoff path, short summary, next action, and one `jq` read command.
