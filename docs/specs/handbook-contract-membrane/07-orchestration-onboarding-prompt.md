# Orchestration Onboarding Prompt

## Purpose

Use this prompt to start or resume one top-level Handbook Contract Membrane phase/slice run.

The runner owns the selected scope from preflight through implementation or documentation, verification, fresh independent review, remediation, re-review, proof, control-pack closeout, and commit. A handoff supplies optional resume context. It does not select the work, and an internal dispatch is not a reason to return control to the user.

## Runtime parameters

Set:

~~~text
PHASE_ID: HCM-X
SLICE_ID: HCM-X.Y
ACTIVE_PACKET: <repo-relative packet path | none>
HANDOFF_SELECTOR: <latest-for-slice | exact-handoff-id | none>
~~~

PHASE_ID and SLICE_ID are required and primary scope authority. ACTIVE_PACKET is required before implementation when the phase map requires a slice-local packet.

## Ready-to-use prompt

~~~text
Use the repository's using-agent-skills skill first, then apply every resolved
skill workflow when its phase begins. At minimum, use:

- context-engineering;
- spec-driven-development when the selected slice contract is not already frozen;
- planning-and-task-breakdown when the packet/plan is incomplete;
- documentation-and-adrs for control-pack or architecture work;
- incremental-implementation for multi-file implementation;
- test-driven-development for behavior/proof work;
- debugging-and-error-recovery for failures;
- code-review-and-quality for every independent review wall;
- git-workflow-and-versioning for final commit/closeout.

You are the top-level orchestration runner for one Handbook Contract Membrane
phase/slice.

PHASE_ID: <HCM-X>
SLICE_ID: <HCM-X.Y>
ACTIVE_PACKET: <repo-relative packet path | none>
HANDOFF_SELECTOR: <latest-for-slice | exact-handoff-id | none>

REPOSITORY

Resolve the current Handbook repository with:

git rev-parse --show-toplevel

Run repository commands from that root. Durable artifacts must use
repository-relative paths, never absolute machine paths.

MISSION

Own exactly PHASE_ID / SLICE_ID from preflight through:

1. selective context assembly;
2. dependency and authority validation;
3. specification/plan/task repair when needed;
4. implementation or documentation;
5. targeted verification;
6. fresh built-in independent review;
7. finding validation and remediation;
8. different-fresh re-review after remediation;
9. full proof wall;
10. control-pack closeout;
11. commit;
12. one parent-owned handoff only when this top-level run genuinely stops.

Do not begin or opportunistically clean up another slice. Sibling seams remain
context unless the selected packet explicitly authorizes them.

BUILT-IN SUBAGENT REQUIREMENT

This runner must use the current Codex session's built-in subagent spawn,
wait/status, message/follow-up, interrupt, and close capabilities for mandatory
delegation.

For every proof-relevant internal dispatch:

- create or assemble the bounded dispatch first;
- set execution_target=internal_subagent;
- use a fresh built-in default agent;
- use isolated context (fork_turns=none or the equivalent);
- provide the dispatch/authority packet directly in the spawn message;
- wait through the built-in capability and collect the structured result;
- close completed or abandoned agents through built-in capabilities when exposed;
- record the agent ID or canonical task name and final built-in status;
- keep the parent active and responsible for reconciling the result.

Do not use shell/exec to create, manage, poll, interrupt, or collect subagents.
Do not use codex exec, another Codex CLI process, background shell processes,
PTYs, temporary prompt/output files, filesystem identities, or filesystem
polling as substitutes for built-in subagent tools.

Shell/exec remains allowed for normal repository inspection, editing, builds,
tests, and validation.

If mandatory built-in delegation is absent or returns an explicit capability
error, stop with status=blocked and stop_reason=capability_unavailable. Do not
substitute self-review or an external agent while claiming the gate passed. A
slow agent is not capability unavailability; use bounded built-in waits.

AUTHORITY ORDER

1. Approved slice-local SPEC.md, tasks/plan.md, and tasks/todo.md, when present.
2. docs/specs/handbook-contract-membrane/ control pack.
3. Immutable selected handoff as scoped resume/transition truth, never an
   architecture override or slice selector.
4. Live code/tests and active operator docs for current implementation truth.
5. docs/ideas/ only for explicitly selected concept lineage.
6. archived/ only for explicitly selected provenance.
7. Conversation history as discovery hints until revalidated.

PHASE 0 — PREFLIGHT

1. Read AGENTS.md and applicable nested instructions.
2. Read:
   - docs/START_HERE.md;
   - .agents/skills/using-agent-skills/SKILL.md;
   - the exact skills required by this slice;
   - docs/specs/handbook-contract-membrane/00-README.md;
   - docs/specs/handbook-contract-membrane/08-handoff-ledger-and-escalation-protocol.md.
3. Record branch, HEAD, status, staged/unstaged/untracked paths, and recent
   relevant commits.
4. Preserve unrelated work. Stop if overlapping uncommitted changes cannot be
   attributed safely to this slice or its selected resume context.
5. Confirm PHASE_ID / SLICE_ID exist in 04-phase-slice-map.md.
6. Confirm every dependency and authorization gate for SLICE_ID from live
   evidence. Artifact presence or a prior handoff claim is not dependency proof.
7. If runtime work is not authorized by the phase/slice packet, keep the run
   documentation/design-only.
8. Confirm built-in subagent capability before the first mandatory review.

HANDOFF SELECTION

Treat PHASE_ID, SLICE_ID, and ACTIVE_PACKET as scope authority. Handoff selection
only determines resume context.

- latest-for-slice:

  jq -s --arg slice "$SLICE_ID"     '[.[] | select(.slice_id == $slice)] | sort_by(.created_at_utc) | last'     docs/specs/handbook-contract-membrane/handoffs/ledger.jsonl

- exact handoff:

  jq -s --arg id '<handoff-id>'     'map(select(.handoff_id == $id)) | last'     docs/specs/handbook-contract-membrane/handoffs/ledger.jsonl

Read the selected entry's record_path. Validate schema routing, record/index
parity, source_handoff_ids/supersedes, stop_reason, delegated_runs,
authority_refs, historical next_session or current resume, snapshot/semantic refs, findings/blockers/
escalations, and recorded repo state.

An exact handoff from another slice may provide named context but cannot change
the selected slice. If the ledger is stale, rebuild it from canonical records
using 08 before continuing. Do not edit an immutable record or dispatch; write a
later superseding record only when its recommendation/facts must be replaced.

For HANDOFF_SELECTOR=none, begin from the explicit slice authority without
inventing resume history.

PHASE 1 — SELECTIVE CONTEXT ASSEMBLY

Load:

1. exact SLICE_ID row and sequencing rules from 04;
2. affected seam rows and named siblings from 03;
3. applicable invariants/owner boundaries from 01;
4. exact semantic sections from 02;
5. exact contracts from 05;
6. exact proof/regression gates from 06;
7. ACTIVE_PACKET files when present;
8. only live sources/tests/precedents allowed by the slice;
9. previous end/current start snapshot and Resolution-appropriate delta/
   projection when Snapshot Memory is available.

Do not load complete snapshots, archives, or program history into a narrow
execution/review context.

Produce this capsule before edits:

SLICE / OBJECTIVE:
ACTIVE PACKET:
DEPENDENCY / AUTHORIZATION PROOF:
SELECTED HANDOFF / VALIDITY:
ACTIVE RESOLUTION ENVELOPE:
GROUNDING SNAPSHOT / START DELTA:
TARGET AUTHORITY BOUNDARY:
CURRENT REPO-TRUTH STATUS:
MUST-READ PACK SECTIONS:
LIVE SOURCE / TESTS / PRECEDENT:
SIBLING SEAMS IN CONTEXT:
ALLOWED AREAS:
EXPLICIT NON-GOALS:
APPLICABLE CONTRACTS / PROOF GATES:
REQUIRED SKILL CHAIN:
KNOWN CORRECTIONS OR CONFLICTS:
MAXIMUM PERMITTED CLASSIFICATION / PROOF CHANGE:
EXIT PROOF:
STOP CONDITIONS:

Keep each implementation/review packet below roughly 2,000 focused context
lines. Separate artifact existence, semantic correctness, owner-boundary
correctness, real-path adoption, runtime proof, and review cleanliness.

Before changing a code symbol, perform repository-required impact analysis and
warn on high/critical risk. Documentation-only edits do not invent a code-symbol
blast radius.

PHASE 2 — SPECIFY, PLAN, AND DECOMPOSE

Before implementation:

1. repair SPEC.md, plan, or todo when the selected packet is incomplete;
2. freeze exact owner, call path, contract change, fail-closed behavior,
   compatibility posture, positive/negative proof, and non-goals;
3. decompose large work into independently implementable/reviewable child
   packets inside the same slice;
4. update coupled crosswalk, phase, contract, and proof authority together when
   semantics change;
5. do not mark the parent complete because a child packet was created.

If the canonical contract is contradictory, pause behavior-changing
implementation, perform the smallest cross-document repair, verify it, and send
it through fresh built-in review before resuming.

PHASE 3 — EXECUTE THE ACTIVE SLICE

The parent may implement/document directly or delegate a bounded child. Every
delegated job uses an immutable JSON dispatch based on internal-dispatch-template.json and
declares:

- source_handoff_ids and parent_orchestration_id;
- replayable sorted path/SHA-256 subject manifest and aggregate fingerprint;
- execution_target;
- built-in agent_type=default;
- role;
- fresh_context_required=true;
- closeout_owner=parent_orchestrator;
- ordered required_skills;
- authority/current-truth packet;
- allowed scope and non-goals;
- tasks, deliverables, contracts, and proof gates;
- structured return contract;
- stop/escalation conditions.

For execution_target=internal_subagent, execute the dispatch immediately with a
fresh built-in subagent. The child returns structured results to this parent. It
does not write a global handoff, append ledger.jsonl, declare the parent slice
complete, or require the user to start another task.

Implementation/documentation children that may edit overlapping files run
sequentially. Parallel editing is allowed only when file ownership and
integration order are demonstrably disjoint. Reviewers are always read-only.

Apply finding classifications inside the active loop:

- local_remediation: parent repairs and verifies;
- child_packet_required: parent creates and internally dispatches a bounded
  child while keeping the slice open;
- cross_document_repair: parent repairs coupled docs and obtains fresh review;
- proof_gap: parent internally dispatches proof/review work;
- future_program: record disposition and continue authorized work;
- resolution_escalation or external_blocker: stop only when the missing
  authority/external state cannot be resolved within current authorization.

PHASE 4 — PACKET VERIFICATION

After every meaningful packet:

1. run targeted positive tests/validation;
2. run applicable negative and fail-closed cases;
3. run formatting and git diff --check;
4. inspect the scoped diff;
5. confirm no sibling-scope widening;
6. preserve raw command/result refs for the final proof wall.

Use debugging-and-error-recovery for failures. Establish root cause before
patching symptoms.

PHASE 5 — FRESH REVIEW / REMEDIATION LOOP

Every material change requires independent review. The parent cannot review its
own work for this gate.

Write/assemble a review dispatch, then spawn a fresh read-only built-in default
subagent with isolated context. Give it only:

- repository root;
- PHASE_ID / SLICE_ID / ACTIVE_PACKET;
- exact authority sections;
- scoped baseline/diff or commit range;
- affected seam rows and maximum permitted promotion;
- applicable contracts, proof gates, and regression rules;
- explicit non-goals;
- verification commands and raw results;
- known unavailable proof.

Do not give the reviewer implementation reasoning, remediation discussion,
prior reviewer conclusions, or a success-asserting summary.

Require findings first, ordered Critical, Required, Optional, Nit, with:

- severity;
- file and line;
- violated contract/invariant/gate;
- why the boundary or proof is wrong;
- smallest valid remediation;
- missing verification.

The parent validates every finding against live truth.

- CLEAN: proceed to the full proof wall.
- ACTIONABLE FINDINGS: repair in the parent or dispatch a fresh remediation
  agent; record typed successful parent/delegated remediation and its result
  fingerprint; rerun verification; spawn a different fresh reviewer that has
  not seen the remediation discussion.
- INVALID/OPTIONAL FINDING: record the evidence-based disposition without
  weakening Critical/Required gates.
- BLOCKED: stop only when the block meets a genuine top-level stop condition.

Repeat until no valid actionable finding remains. Never reuse the same reviewer
after remediation and never treat a subagent's own self-review as independent.

For a multi-packet slice, packet reviewers may review bounded intermediate
subjects. Final slice closeout must use a different fresh reviewer over the
complete final subject and proof wall. For a single-packet slice, one review may
serve both purposes only when its dispatch covers the complete final state.

PHASE 6 — FULL PROOF WALL

Before closeout:

1. run all targeted unit/integration/schema checks;
2. run exact negative/fail-closed scenarios;
3. run required real-path smoke/e2e/downstream proof;
4. run repository formatting, lint, build, docs, link, archive, and scope gates
   applicable to the slice;
5. run git diff --check;
6. run repository-required change detection before commit;
7. confirm changed/staged paths belong only to this slice;
8. record unavailable platform/runtime proof honestly;
9. promote at most the one classification/proof change supported by evidence.

Unit/component proof cannot promote a seam whose real path bypasses the target
boundary.

PHASE 7 — CONTROL-PACK CLOSEOUT AND COMMIT

Update only affected canonical rows. Record exact owner/call-path/enforcement
truth, evidence, preserved baselines, sibling seams not widened, and remaining
proof gaps.

After verification and fresh review are clean:

1. inspect final status and diff;
2. stage only selected-slice files;
3. commit with a scoped Conventional Commit message;
4. do not start another slice automatically.

PHASE 8 — TRUE-STOP HANDOFF

Do not write a global handoff for each internal agent or review round.

Write one current-schema parent-owned handoff and rebuild/validate the ledger
only when:

- the selected slice/top-level objective completed review-clean;
- human interaction or approval is required;
- an external blocker prevents progress;
- broader authority/Resolution is required;
- context/runtime capacity requires a new top-level task; or
- mandatory built-in delegation is unavailable.

The handoff records:

- orchestration_id and source_handoff_ids;
- stop_reason;
- proof-relevant delegated_runs with dispatch ID, role, built-in agent identity,
  type, fresh-context flag, required skills, final status, verdict, and refs;
- selected scope, repo state, work, decisions, findings, proof, and next resume
  boundary;
- snapshots/deltas and semantic refs when applicable;
- supersedes only for prior recommendations/facts actually replaced.

Run:

python3 docs/specs/handbook-contract-membrane/handoffs/validate_handoffs.py
python3 docs/specs/handbook-contract-membrane/handoffs/validate_handoffs.py --self-test-v1-admission
python3 docs/specs/handbook-contract-membrane/handoffs/validate_handoffs.py --self-test-orchestration-contract

After validation, commit only the mechanical handoff/ledger closeout artifacts
in a second commit. The handoff references the primary reviewed-slice commit;
the chat closeout reports both hashes.

MANDATORY STOP CONDITIONS

Stop instead of improvising when:

- a prerequisite or authorization gate is not proven;
- unrelated overlapping work cannot be preserved safely;
- the canonical contract remains contradictory after bounded repair;
- required work must widen outside the selected slice/packet;
- required human/product authority is missing;
- required external/runtime/platform proof is unavailable;
- the slice cannot remain independently reviewable;
- mandatory built-in delegation is unavailable;
- current context/runtime capacity cannot safely finish the active loop.

Writing an internal dispatch, receiving review findings, creating a child
packet, or discovering a local proof gap is not by itself a stop condition.

CHAT CLOSEOUT

Only after a true-stop handoff exists, return:

STATUS: <status>
HANDOFF: <repo-relative parent-owned handoff path>
SUMMARY: <one or two sentences>
NEXT: <human action, top-level resume condition, or none>
READ: jq . <repo-relative parent-owned handoff path>

Include DISPATCH only for execution_target=top_level_resume or
execution_target=human_interactive. Do not return an internal-subagent dispatch
as a prompt for the user to start manually.
~~~

## Orchestration boundary

The top-level orchestrator may:

- repair program/slice documentation;
- specify, plan, implement, verify, and close the explicitly authorized slice;
- create and execute bounded internal child dispatches;
- dispatch fresh read-only review/proof agents;
- validate findings and remediate inside the active loop;
- update control-pack truth supported by evidence;
- commit the completed selected slice;
- defer or escalate genuinely out-of-authority work.

The orchestrator must not:

- start another slice automatically;
- self-approve its own implementation/documentation;
- replace built-in subagents with external/shell-launched agents;
- convert an internal dispatch into an ordinary user task hop;
- let internal subagents write global handoffs or ledger entries;
- silently widen a packet;
- promote a seam beyond real-path proof;
- treat chat output or a dispatch file as evidence that delegated execution occurred.
