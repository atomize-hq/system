# Seam Crosswalk

## Purpose

This document separates current artifacts from target semantics. Re-check the live tree before each slice and update affected rows when their classification changes.

## Classification rules

- Classify the seam as a whole, not the best helper inside it.
- Keep artifact existence, semantic correctness, owner-boundary correctness, real-path adoption, and runtime proof separate.
- A published crate proves distribution, not every future API.
- A passing unit test does not prove CLI, Tauri, Substrate, or dock integration.
- Archived planning is provenance, not current implementation truth.

## Current-to-target crosswalk

| Seam | Current live truth | Current classification | Target owner | Required action | Sibling dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Canonical artifact kinds | `CanonicalArtifactKind` is a fixed four-variant enum: Charter, ProjectContext, EnvironmentInventory, FeatureSpec | `UsefulPrecursor` | `handbook-engine` profile/artifact kernel | Replace enum-owned universe with profile-resolved descriptors while retaining stable first-party role IDs | profile schema, generic validation, setup/doctor/flow |
| Canonical layout | `CanonicalLayoutContract` parameterizes paths but still has dedicated fields for fixed artifact kinds | `UsefulPrecursor` | `handbook-engine` | Move to descriptor-driven layout resolved from the instance profile | artifact registry, trusted repo-relative paths |
| Structured authoring | Charter, Project Context, and Environment Inventory accept structured YAML inputs and deterministically render Markdown | `UsefulPrecursor` | `handbook-engine` | Invert authority so meaningful YAML is canonical and Markdown is derived | artifact schemas, projections, cutover gate |
| Markdown validation | Baseline validation dispatches artifact-specific Markdown validators | `UsefulPrecursor` | `handbook-engine` | Validate canonical structured truth first; validate rendered views only as projections/witnesses where valuable | canonical YAML, renderer proof |
| Setup scaffolding | Setup emits fixed directories/templates for shipped artifacts | `UsefulPrecursor` | SDK/use case over engine | Generate the selected shipped or repository profile directly; no user legacy migration mode | profile loader, CLI UX |
| Doctor baseline | `handbook doctor --json` reports fixed baseline artifacts and safe next actions | `UsefulPrecursor` | SDK + CLI renderer | Make doctor profile-aware and fully schema-versioned while preserving typed blocked/refused semantics | artifact registry, JSON protocol |
| Flow resolver | `ResolveRequest` selects packet ID plus byte-budget policy; `resolve_with_contract` accepts a layout contract | `BoundaryLanded` for current reduced scope | `handbook-flow` | Add profile and Context Resolution inputs; return projection-aware selection and omission truth | profile kernel, Resolution envelope, SDK DTOs |
| Context budgeting | Flow can keep, summarize, exclude, or refuse by byte size | `UsefulPrecursor` | `handbook-flow` | Keep byte policy as one resource constraint beneath semantic Resolution; do not equate size with granularity | projection engine, omission accounting |
| Pipeline work levels | Stages carry `work_level`; compiler filters `SCOPE` blocks against L0-L3 | `UsefulPrecursor` | `handbook-pipeline` consuming shared Resolution types | Generalize to namespaced Context Resolution and migrate scoped rules without freezing L0-L3 as final semantics | profile resolution stack, pipeline definitions |
| Resolution-aware artifact views | Archived map planned low/normal/high reconstruction; no general live projection API exists | `TargetOnly` | engine/flow split to be frozen | Implement deterministic reveal/derive with provenance and omission truth | canonical YAML, profile, Resolution |
| Vocabulary | Stage/template/content language embeds sprint, release, feature, slice, packet, task, and fixed artifact labels | `TargetOnly` | profile semantic kernel + renderers | Introduce axis-based vocabulary and explicit lexical/structural conflation | profile schema, all projections |
| Public owner crates | `handbook-engine 0.1.1`, `handbook-flow 0.1.1`, and `handbook-pipeline 0.1.2` are published; released-boundary proof exists | `ContractCorrectAndProven` for the exact proved APIs only | existing owner crates | Preserve narrow public capabilities; expand only through reviewed public contracts and new released proof | SDK facade, Substrate consumer tests |
| Compiler seam | `handbook-compiler` is a CLI-facing compatibility/support crate spanning unresolved shell seams | `UsefulPrecursor` | owner crates + proposed SDK | Do not promote it by default; decide whether remaining logic moves to SDK, CLI shell, or owner crates | owner-boundary design slice |
| Consumer facade | No purpose-named ordinary-consumer SDK crate exists | `TargetOnly` | proposed `handbook-sdk` | Define minimal use cases and DTOs; keep owner crates public for advanced use | JSON Schema, CLI/Tauri/Substrate adapters |
| CLI transport | CLI owns command parsing and several renderers but still depends on compatibility seams | `UsefulPrecursor` | `handbook-cli` over SDK | Preserve polished UX while removing domain decisions from CLI modules | SDK, common response envelope |
| CLI JSON | `doctor` has explicit `--json`; other JSON behavior is partial or command-specific | `UsefulPrecursor` | SDK DTOs + CLI transport | Provide one versioned JSON envelope for every nontrivial operation; stdout must remain machine-clean | schema generation, exit policy |
| Installed Handbook skill | Current installed skill directs agents to gather facts, prepare YAML inputs, invoke the CLI, and require `doctor --json`; it is fixed to the current three baseline artifacts | `UsefulPrecursor` | skill adapter over CLI/SDK capability truth | Preserve skill-directed deterministic CLI use; make artifact/profile/vocabulary/Resolution instructions capability-driven; do not add nested synthesis | SDK capability reporting, full JSON, profile kernel |
| Tauri | No Tauri application or adapter exists | `TargetOnly` | future Tauri shell over SDK | Reuse Serde DTOs/use cases; do not shell out for normal operation | SDK and JSON Schema parity |
| Initial Substrate CLI bridge | Approved as a possible first product integration; not yet implemented for the membrane | `TargetOnly` | Substrate adapter consuming CLI JSON | Bundle exact binary/protocol version and isolate replaceable bridge | full CLI JSON, capability reporting |
| Direct Substrate imports | Engine/flow proof and released pipeline proof show real published consumption is viable | `RealPathAdopted` for narrow existing seams | Substrate consuming published owner/SDK crates | Preserve exact-version proof and extend to each downstream-intended membrane API | crates.io publication, real worktree seam |
| Contract membrane | Idea docs define lifecycle, claims, evidence, verdicts, gates, and dock semantics; no general live system exists | `TargetOnly` | owner decision pending; Handbook authority | Freeze typed core and lifecycle without creating a universal validator | canonical artifacts, SDK, docks |
| External docks | Dock taxonomy and mental model exist only in architecture docs | `TargetOnly` | Handbook dock protocol + separable implementations | Define semantic protocol; implement process JSON first; normalize evidence | contract core, JSON schemas, capability manifest |
| AI synthesis | Handbook has no target requirement for model-generated canonical projections; Substrate already uses Unified Agent API | `TargetOnly` optional | Substrate or optional Handbook adapter | Keep initial projections deterministic; future Handbook synthesis must use UAA programmatically and remain candidate-only | promotion gate, provenance |
| Orchestration handoff | Prior sessions rely heavily on chat closeout and manual copy/paste | `TargetOnly` becoming documented by this pack | control-pack protocol | Require immutable handoff records, escalation classification, and durable next-session dispatches | orchestration prompt, handoff schema |

## High-risk coupling zones

### Fixed artifact identity

The fixed artifact enum flows into:

- canonical paths and layout;
- setup scaffolding;
- baseline validation;
- doctor output;
- flow resolver priority and packet assembly;
- rendering and tests.

Do not treat descriptor generalization as a local enum refactor.

### Markdown-first assumptions

Markdown authority is embedded across:

- authoring write paths;
- starter-template detection;
- baseline validation;
- resolver ingestion;
- tests and fixtures;
- environment-inventory references.

The greenfield cutover may replace these directly, but slice boundaries must keep the tree coherent and delete temporary bridges on schedule.

### CLI and compatibility logic

The current CLI is not yet a pure adapter, and `handbook-compiler` still owns support seams. The SDK slice must first inventory actual use-case composition. It must not create a facade that merely republishes CLI wording.

### Pipeline/Resolution semantics

Current work levels are embedded in stage files, rule filters, catalog rendering, and tests. The new Resolution model must preserve useful scoped behavior while replacing the mixed L0-L3 taxonomy.

## Crosswalk update rule

When a slice changes a seam:

1. update its current live truth;
2. record the exact evidence refs;
3. change at most to the classification supported by that evidence;
4. update `06-proof-and-regression-ledger.md`;
5. write the closeout handoff record;
6. leave sibling rows unchanged unless the same proof actually exercised them.
