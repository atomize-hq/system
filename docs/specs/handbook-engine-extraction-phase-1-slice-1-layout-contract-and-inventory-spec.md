# Spec: Handbook Engine Extraction Phase 1 Slice 1 - Layout Contract And Inventory

## Assumptions

1. This slice is a **contract-and-inventory** slice, not a caller-migration slice.
2. The root extraction plan remains authoritative for phase order, and `docs/specs/handbook-engine-extraction-slice-map.md` remains authoritative for the Phase -> Slice -> Packet breakdown.
3. The locked decision in `HANDBOOK_ENGINE_EXTRACTION_PLAN.md` stands: use **separate layout types**, not one global layout object.
4. Slice 1.1 may land docs and behavior-neutral contract scaffolding, but it must not widen into the adoption work reserved for Slices 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4.
5. For this slice, the required inventory corpus is the reusable-internal `.handbook/**` and `.handbook/state/**` references in the compiler sources named in the slice map; CLI/product-shell references are auxiliary context and must be called out explicitly if excluded.

## Objective

Freeze the Phase 1 layout contract and produce the reusable-internal storage inventory that later Phase 1 slices will adopt.

The user is the maintainer of the handbook workspace and the future reviewer of the extraction sequence. The immediate outcome is not a functional migration. The immediate outcome is a durable slice-local authority set that answers:

- which layout ownership domains exist
- which files currently own `.handbook/**` and `.handbook/state/**` assumptions
- which later slice is responsible for adopting each assumption behind the approved layout contract
- which references are intentionally excluded because they are CLI/product-shell-only or otherwise outside Slice 1.1

Success means future migration slices do not have to rediscover the path/storage shape while editing production code.

## Slice Scope

In scope:

- freeze the layout type-family contract for Phase 1
- freeze the reusable-internal inventory for the targeted compiler files
- classify references by ownership domain
- mark temporary exceptions, exclusions, and indirect dependencies explicitly
- hand off a clear adoption map to Slices 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4

Out of scope:

- changing production path behavior
- moving callers to the new layout contract
- rewriting CLI/product wording
- parameterizing orchestration targets or template resolution
- Phase 4 crate-boundary work or Phase 6 Substrate migration planning

## Authority Inputs

- `HANDBOOK_ENGINE_EXTRACTION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/specs/handbook-engine-extraction-slice-map.md`
- Current compiler sources named by Slice 1.1:
  - `crates/compiler/src/canonical_artifacts.rs`
  - `crates/compiler/src/route_state.rs`
  - `crates/compiler/src/pipeline_capture.rs`
  - `crates/compiler/src/pipeline_handoff.rs`
  - `crates/compiler/src/stage_10_feature_spec_provenance.rs`
  - `crates/compiler/src/setup.rs`
  - `crates/compiler/src/author/charter.rs`
  - `crates/compiler/src/author/project_context.rs`
  - `crates/compiler/src/author/environment_inventory.rs`
- Auxiliary exclusion/context corpus:
  - `crates/cli/src/main.rs`

## Tech Stack

- Rust 2021 workspace
- `handbook-compiler` library crate
- `handbook-cli` binary crate
- Repo-local canonical storage under `.handbook/**`
- Repo-local runtime state under `.handbook/state/**`
- Additional artifact outputs such as `artifacts/**` that must still fit the future layout type family even when they are not part of the slice verifier corpus

## Commands

Slice 1.1 inventory query:

```bash
rg -n "\.handbook|\.handbook/state" crates/compiler/src crates/cli/src
```

Targeted compiler-only inventory query:

```bash
rg -n "\.handbook|\.handbook/state" \
  crates/compiler/src/canonical_artifacts.rs \
  crates/compiler/src/route_state.rs \
  crates/compiler/src/pipeline_capture.rs \
  crates/compiler/src/pipeline_handoff.rs \
  crates/compiler/src/stage_10_feature_spec_provenance.rs \
  crates/compiler/src/setup.rs \
  crates/compiler/src/author/charter.rs \
  crates/compiler/src/author/project_context.rs \
  crates/compiler/src/author/environment_inventory.rs
```

Behavior-neutral compile rail if contract scaffolding is added later:

```bash
cargo check --workspace
```

Repo verification wall if a later implementation packet introduces code:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo check --workspace
```

```

## Code Style

Prefer separate ownership types anchored to one repo root over scattered string literals or one oversized global layout object.

```rust
let repo = RepoLayoutRoot::new(repo_root)?;
let canonical = CanonicalLayout::new(&repo);
let runtime_state = RuntimeStateLayout::new(&repo);
let authoring = AuthoringLayout::new(&repo);
```

Conventions for this slice:

- one layout type per ownership domain
- one domain owner per path family
- later callers consume typed accessors; Slice 1.1 does not migrate them yet
- path literals remain allowed only inside the approved owner until later slices complete adoption
- inventory rows must distinguish reusable-internal ownership from product-shell wording

## Testing Strategy

Primary verification for this slice is **corpus completeness and contract consistency**, not runtime behavior change.

Test levels:

- document review against the root plan and slice map
- `rg`-based inventory verification against the targeted compiler corpus
- explicit exclusion review for CLI/product-shell references
- `cargo check --workspace` only if a later Slice 1.1 implementation packet adds behavior-neutral code scaffolding

Coverage expectation:

- every targeted compiler file named in the slice map appears in the inventory freeze below
- every direct `.handbook/**` or `.handbook/state/**` ownership assumption in those files is classified by owner and follow-on slice
- excluded references are called out explicitly, not silently omitted

## Boundaries

- Always:
  - preserve the locked decision to use separate layout types rather than one global layout object
  - keep Slice 1.1 bounded to contract definition and inventory freeze
  - classify references by owner and by follow-on adoption slice
  - mark product-shell-only, indirect, or no-hit files explicitly
- Ask first:
  - changing production path semantics
  - adding new crates or dependencies
  - widening into Slice 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4 adoption work
  - changing public CLI help text or operator wording
- Never:
  - collapse the future layout family into one monolithic layout object
  - start migrating callers in Slice 1.1
  - silently omit inventory hits or exclusions
  - treat reusable-internal storage ownership and product-shell wording as the same class of reference

## Success Criteria

- Slice 1.1 defines the approved layout ownership domains for Phase 1.
- Slice 1.1 explicitly rejects a single global layout object and freezes a **layout type family** approach.
- The targeted compiler corpus has a durable inventory table with one row per file and explicit ownership classification.
- Each inventoried assumption names the follow-on adoption slice: 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4.
- CLI/product-shell references are explicitly marked as exclusions or auxiliary context.
- No caller migration is required for Slice 1.1 completion.
- The slice produces exactly two implementation packets:
  - `Packet 1.1.1: Layout Type Family And Ownership Boundary`
  - `Packet 1.1.2: Storage Inventory And Temporary-Exception Freeze`

## Open Questions

- Should the future layout contract live in one `layout.rs` module, a `layout/` module tree, or remain docs-only until Slice 1.2 starts adoption?
- Should the future handoff bundle layout owner be introduced during Phase 1 adoption work even though the Slice 1.1 verifier corpus is primarily `.handbook/**` and `.handbook/state/**`?
- Should CLI fixture-path references eventually receive their own product-shell-only inventory appendix, or is explicit exclusion in this slice sufficient?

## Layout Ownership Domains Frozen By Slice 1.1

The exact Rust type names may still change during implementation, but the ownership domains are fixed by this slice.

| Ownership domain | What it owns | Primary current sources | Expected follow-on adoption slice |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical root layout | canonical `.handbook` root and canonical artifact namespace roots | `canonical_artifacts.rs`, `setup.rs` | Slice 1.2 |
| Runtime state layout | `.handbook/state/**` root and runtime-state subtree ownership | `setup.rs`, `route_state.rs` | Slice 1.3 |
| Capture provenance layout | stage-capture and capture-cache storage under runtime state | `pipeline_capture.rs`, `stage_10_feature_spec_provenance.rs` | Slice 1.3 |
| Handoff bundle layout | handoff bundle roots and future bundle ownership | `pipeline_handoff.rs` | Slice 1.3 |
| Authoring layout | canonical authoring paths and authoring lock paths | `author/charter.rs`, `author/project_context.rs`, `author/environment_inventory.rs` | Slice 1.4 |

## Slice 1.1 Inventory Freeze

### Reusable-internal compiler corpus

| File | Current assumption shape | Ownership domain | Classification | Follow-on slice | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `crates/compiler/src/canonical_artifacts.rs` | hardcoded `.handbook` root plus canonical artifact relative paths such as `.handbook/charter/CHARTER.md` and namespace dirs | Canonical root layout | direct reusable-internal owner | Slice 1.2 | This file is the current canonical-root authority and must become a layout consumer later without losing artifact identity semantics. |
| `crates/compiler/src/setup.rs` | direct `repo_root.join(".handbook")` root establishment and runtime-state reset language around `.handbook/state/**` | Canonical root layout + Runtime state layout | direct reusable-internal owner | Slice 1.2 for canonical root; Slice 1.3 for runtime state | Setup owns establishment and repair today; later slices should separate owner from setup-specific mutation flow. |
| `crates/compiler/src/route_state.rs` | `.handbook/state` root, runtime-state inventory/reset traversal, and runtime-state file expectations | Runtime state layout | direct reusable-internal owner | Slice 1.3 | Keep route-state domain logic local later; only storage ownership should move behind the layout contract. |
| `crates/compiler/src/pipeline_capture.rs` | capture-cache repo-relative path `.handbook/state/pipeline/capture/{capture_id}.yaml` | Capture provenance layout | direct reusable-internal owner | Slice 1.3 | Capture cache belongs to the runtime-state subtree but should have a narrower owner than generic route state. |
| `crates/compiler/src/stage_10_feature_spec_provenance.rs` | stage-capture provenance path `.handbook/state/pipeline/stage_capture/...json` | Capture provenance layout | direct reusable-internal owner | Slice 1.3 | This is the cleanest dedicated provenance-path owner in the current compiler corpus. |
| `crates/compiler/src/pipeline_handoff.rs` | no direct `.handbook/**` literal in the current slice verifier corpus; indirect dependency on capture provenance and bundle-root ownership | Handoff bundle layout | indirect dependency / no direct hit | Slice 1.3 | Included so the slice records that handoff ownership exists even though the current `.handbook` inventory query does not hit this file directly. |
| `crates/compiler/src/author/charter.rs` | canonical authoring target `.handbook/charter/CHARTER.md`, default exception location, and `.handbook/state/authoring/charter.lock` | Authoring layout | direct reusable-internal owner | Slice 1.4 | Includes both storage ownership and user-facing path mentions; later adoption should move only the owner rules first. |
| `crates/compiler/src/author/project_context.rs` | canonical authoring target `.handbook/project_context/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and `.handbook/state/authoring/project_context.lock` | Authoring layout | direct reusable-internal owner | Slice 1.4 | Same owner class as charter, but project-context-specific wording remains local. |
| `crates/compiler/src/author/environment_inventory.rs` | canonical authoring target `.handbook/environment_inventory/ENVIRONMENT_INVENTORY.md`, `.handbook/state/authoring/environment_inventory.lock`, and references to upstream canonical authoring files | Authoring layout | direct reusable-internal owner | Slice 1.4 | This file also references other canonical authoring paths in prompts and validations; storage ownership still belongs to the authoring layout owner. |

### Explicit exclusions and auxiliary context

| File | Reason it is not part of Slice 1.1 reusable-internal acceptance | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `crates/cli/src/main.rs` | contains many `.handbook/**` path mentions, fixture paths, and operator wording, but those are product-shell concerns rather than reusable-internal layout ownership | explicit product-shell exclusion |

### Temporary exceptions frozen by this slice

- User-facing and prompt-facing `.handbook/**` string mentions inside the authoring modules remain allowed in Slice 1.1 as long as the storage owner is classified correctly.
- `pipeline_handoff.rs` remains a recorded indirect dependency even though the current verifier query does not produce a direct `.handbook` hit there.
- Non-`.handbook` layout owners such as `artifacts/handoff/**` are part of the future type family but are not the primary verifier corpus for Packet 1.1.2.

## Packet Breakdown

### Packet 1.1.1: Layout Type Family And Ownership Boundary

Goal:

- freeze the ownership domains and no-migration boundary for Slice 1.1

Required outcome:

- the slice authority set names the layout family and the adoption handoff for later slices

### Packet 1.1.2: Storage Inventory And Temporary-Exception Freeze

Goal:

- capture the full reusable-internal `.handbook/**` / `.handbook/state/**` inventory for the targeted compiler corpus and mark exclusions explicitly

Required outcome:

- later slices can adopt the approved contract without rediscovering ownership or missing deferred references
