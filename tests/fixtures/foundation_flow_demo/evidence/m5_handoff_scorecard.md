# M5 Handoff Scorecard

## Same Job
- Job: derive a bounded slice plan for the M4 happy-path feature from the emitted handoff bundle.
- Feature ID: `fs-m4-foundation-journey-2026-04`
- Output parity: identical `SLICE_PLAN.md`
- Bundle Root: `artifacts/handoff/feature_slice/fs-m4-foundation-journey-2026-04`

## Access Comparison
| Metric | Repo-reread baseline | Bundle-only consumer | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Repo rereads | 6 | 0 | -6 |
| Total grounding reads | 9 | 7 | -2 |
| Bundle reads | 3 | 7 | +4 |

## Before: Repo-Reread Baseline
- Bundle reads:
  - handoff_manifest.json
  - read_allowlist.json
  - trust_matrix.md
- Repo rereads:
  - artifacts/feature_spec/FEATURE_SPEC.md
  - artifacts/foundation/FOUNDATION_STRATEGY.md
  - artifacts/foundation/TECH_ARCH_BRIEF.md
  - artifacts/foundation/QUALITY_GATES_SPEC.md
  - pipelines/foundation_inputs.yaml
  - core/stages/10_feature_spec.md

## After: Bundle-Only Consumer
- Bundle reads:
  - handoff_manifest.json
  - read_allowlist.json
  - trust_matrix.md
  - inputs/external_manual_derived/artifacts/feature_spec/FEATURE_SPEC.md
  - inputs/compiler_derived/artifacts/foundation/FOUNDATION_STRATEGY.md
  - inputs/compiler_derived/artifacts/foundation/TECH_ARCH_BRIEF.md
  - inputs/compiler_derived/artifacts/foundation/QUALITY_GATES_SPEC.md
- Repo rereads:
  - none

## Conclusion
- The same planning job now completes with zero repo rereads.
- Grounding moved from canonical repo surfaces to emitted bundle copies, reducing total reads while keeping the output identical.
